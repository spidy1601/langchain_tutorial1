Unit 10 - Topic 1.webm: welcome to unit ten managing organizational change in this unit we'll discuss an explore how to manage organizational change with a focus on the integration of project management and service management practices as well as considering the human factors of organizational change when you complete this unit you'll be able to describe and discuss the human factors of organizational change and present a change management plan that includes both project management and service management we have three topics in this unit organizational change organizational change models and change model success we are starting a different book for this unit the it in organizational change book by pamela ers for this unit we'll be reviewing four chapters chapters two three four and five you'll find this book on o'reilly like our other books so let's get started with our very first topic organizational change so to begin with let's start by acknowledging that change is scary change scares most people and it doesn't matter who you are or where you are an organization that change can still cause out anxiety or worry some people even don't realize that that's what's happening but as you lead change management projects and processes it's very important to understand the human dimension of of change so let's take a moment and explore why changes scary well we have three key things that cause this that there's new things to learn new risks and of course the fear of failure when a change occurs leading learning always needs to take place we're going to need to learn new things we're have to in especially within an it organizations we could have new technologies but invariably we'll have new processes to learn and follow so what happens if we make a mistake as part of this new change will the consequences of such a mistake b will we be less effective in our role will we be seen as less competent could we potentially have a negative impact on our career or even a job loss this really comes down to self doubt and a small percentage of individuals may become so overwhelmed overwhelmed by self doubt that they self select and will just opt out of the change looking for a different role in the organization or even leaving the organization entirely it's important that we recognize as potential outcome and if appropriate accepted it not everyone will be able to move along with every single change and the larger the change the more impactful and the more foundational to the organization it is important to to keep these things in mind change we really do wanna bring as many people as possible along with a change though so it's very important that we keep morale up and a negative attitude towards a change is a very good and can typically accurate indicator that the employee is uncomfortable with the change itself we certainly want everyone to be successful a hundred percent engagement and adoption of a new change is a great outcome it's rare but great so we wanna make sure that we're supporting those who are having some difficulty we need to make sure though that we don't allow those negative attitudes to negatively affect or diminish the morale of the team if the challenge is something like the inability to complete a task or an assignment typically this is relatively straightforward to resolve by providing additional support or training holding the team accountable and let's not forget asking what kind of help that team member would need however altering someone's attitude is much more challenging and also if if it persists it cannot be ignored it certainly could have a detrimental effect on the entire team a negative attitude is often the sign that an employee is comfortable with the change itself and their abilities to perform at the same level given the changed environment so what our book is saying there is that if people are worried they're not gonna be successful with their new duties or with a new process season that might manifest or present itself in the workplace as being negative about the change as opposed to talking about and of course that would require being vulnerable but talking about and acknowledging the issue keep in mind they may not even be aware of that so how do we address this fear of change well our book talks about some key things communication training documentation emotional safety quite important celebrating success and senior leadership support so let's start with that communication part it's so important to provide everyone with the correct and timely information about the project and the changes routine weekly email and update newsletter lunch and learn session or some other kind of communication but we do really need to provide this we need to make sure we're providing sufficient to training and documentation for the change otherwise that change will definitely not be successful every person on the team needs to understand and believe that they have the tools and the knowledge necessary for the job and that they play an important role the six assess of the change even when that change doesn't seem to be significant it might might appear to be minor the individual responsible for them and result might they that person might feel overwhelmed by the change so it's really important that we check with people and we'll talk more about that we talk about emotional safety but it's also important when we're doing the training and documentation and indeed even the communication which is really a a kind of documentation we need to make sure we're providing people multiple options for obtaining the information in multiple options and opportunities to ask questions so moving on to emotional safety when a mistake is made during the transition of a new change so we need to be sure that we that the environment we are creating for that change is safe and it reinforces that it supports and provides appreciation for those who are doing the the hard work and being vulnerable and trying to adopt the new change and especially when they have not been successful with that we need to celebrate and and thank them for sharing that for coming forward and then we need to ask them how how can we best support you we also need to be thinking about how we announce the mistake more broadly not in any way to shame them or provide any kind of discipline in fact the exact opposite we need to model that making a mistake is okay and that we are all able to learn from it and to thank them for taking on that difficult work when we experience success when we start seeing positive signals that our change is is working we need to make sure that we publicized and share that success we just socialize those success stories this can be hard to measure but at a minimum recognizing individual success and the department of success is a is a critical thing and finding the right way to measure those inside of your organization is very important now we can't underestimate how important senior leadership support its for a successful change project and sometimes senior leaders and themselves don't fully appreciate how impactful or how influential they are in these kinds of projects sincere recognition from a senior leader it is a powerful response to success or failure when it's been acknowledged and addressed and you know it's important to keep in mind that senior leaders typically are gonna be the people accountable to the organization not only for this change but also also for employee engagement in for morale overall when we talk about employee engagement just to be clear what we're referring to is is an employee or team member's commitment their involvement but also their satisfaction and they'll work within the organization when we have an emotional and and intellectual going into our work then the mission the vision and our performance within the organization is all positively impacted and we typically see better outcomes there's a really great story in the in the in this chapter from the book that talks about a story from the trenches a real world story from their person experience and i i turned this one story into a timeline and we'll review it slightly each of the channel four chapters have this conclude with this kind of story this is the only one i'm gonna go into with any depth i really encourage you to read those stories i think those stories are very powerful learning tools but it's a not the kind of thing that i basically it's it's hard to review without simply reading the store but i really like this one i i wanted to break this one down because we see a couple of big things this first hired to help the company with some big changes and they identify some key problems then they have a plan for changes but you'll notice that in the plan they didn't consult they didn't listen right and as part of the in the story as the story reveals they actually hired a number of new managers as well so they didn't have the institutional knowledge they didn't have their arms around the culture of the organization they didn't talk to these senior people not by role by tenure by experience by responsibility in the organization so when they announced the change what they did what they encountered wasn't the excitement of a new change which is you know what everyone dreamed of rarely happens but they experience quite a bit of resistance we'll talk about a resistance quite a bit more as we go through especially looking at some of the models or the change management models but what we see in this story is that by not talking to people by not consulting it it what they did is they provided a top down not bottom up or collaborative inclusive change plan and if you get left out of the plans especially the plan misses some key things because you didn't consult with the right people in the organization then very understandably you're gonna face a a lack of trust in the frustration attention and anger this whole idea of resistance is very important you know they say that not they the book states that job large job related changes can you know have caused people to feel much the same than we do when we experience any kind of grief that you might be familiar with the language with the five stages of grief more properly the cooper ross grief cycle we go through denial anger depression bargaining and then finally acceptance i've no doubt that some of the teams went through the cycle but the management team also went through the cycle when they realize that the plan was not well accepted and they had made a significant error and needed to to figure out how to how to remediate that i like this particular graph because it does a good job with a of just providing a visualization of the cooper ross each cycle i particularly like this blue bar across the bottom because it provides you as a leader with some clear direct on what you need or what i what is most likely to benefit the people you're supporting as they go through this cycle and for the those first two phases of denial on angry we wanna focus on information and communication and then when they enter depression and it might not be depression in the workplace but look at these other words overwhelmed helpless as hostility fighting things like that that's time for emotional support it's really important to bring our whole self to work and acknowledge that we have feelings and engage with those feelings and then as people are emerging from this cycle and moving towards acceptance then we can provide guidance and direction now in terms of the human aspect of change it i really that's very much what this entire unit is about and we've we've talked about the human aspects of changed throughout the entire course this is a good time to just really very clearly remind you as we bring this course to an end that there's no project there's no service that does not require people to be successful and that you're serving people so that that these things have a profoundly human aspect of them is very very important and should not be that surprising to us but it's very important that we don't forget that so considering the human aspect of change and ensuring the right plans in place not only is gonna get us a better outcome for the people we serve it's also gonna get us a better outcome for ourselves for our teammates for our organization overall and that props up organizational change
Unit 10 - Topic 2.webm: and now move on to organizational change models so let's make sure we're all on the same page and level set on what change models are these are a process to manage organizational change and they're gonna be an in so what is an organizational change that one time we're gonna make a modification introduce something new or and any part of our structure operations technology or culture we're gonna wanna be thinking about how we're going to manage that organizational change these different models provide us with a shared system and vocabulary to manage these kinds of changes and typically they're structured as a sequence of steps or phases sometimes you'll iterate on them or loop two parts of them but typically they're set up as a as a sequence different models can definitely be used together our book refers as to as a hybrid model based on the type of change in or when is it organizational culture you're looking for or sorry that you have so why would we do this what why would we spend all of this time on the learning about and then using these different organizational change models well hey it's important to keep in mind failure is always an option there's no guarantee that anything's is gonna be successful it not not the least is these this kind of organizational change which is very challenging i mean often fails or does not fully meet the success criteria outlined these change models gonna help us maximize success it's certainly not a guarantee but they're they're well proven so you know the they give us patterns to to to use in our work based on what has been successful and researched and and proven elsewhere it gives us an opportunity to plan the plan so we don't have to go deeper than that this isn't planning inception we don't have to plan the plan for the plan but we you know this gives us a chance for a large project and almost all organizational change is gonna be relatively large and complicated with many moving parts in different departments typically when you look at that kind of thing making sure we have a plan for the plan itself really helps us understand what we what the scope of the work is gonna be and certainly gives us a significant advantage in understanding things like scheduling and results percent and lastly as i've already mentioned it gives us a common vocabulary gives us a common reference for this change process overall it these different change models provide a structure and a narrative for the change process that's gonna make it easier for us to describe and inform the people who need to to approve of the change but also than those who are required to undertake and perform the change and lastly by taking on these change models especially when we are able to use the same model or combination with models repeatedly with an organization what this does is provides creates institutional knowledge to develop through that reuse and give us some momentum or a stronger foundation for future changes we'll be taking a look at five different organizational change models so they're called ad car the six change model frees chain from mckinsey sub s and carter's eighth step and we'll dive into the first one right away ad carr is an acronym for awareness desire knowledge eligibility and reinforcement it was developed by pros sign the late nineties and it focuses on activities that achieve results it's very old oriented and the ad car model can help with diagnosing resistance to change and setting development related goals for the people who are undertaking that change so let's take a brief look at each of the parts of ad card the first is awareness and it takes a look at why is the change necessary this information will sorry who who why is it looking at why is this change necessary so we need to gather information about why the change is necessary so that we can communicate it to the organization both for approval planning but also for the actual work itself when we have this information it provides a solid base for all of the q actions that will be defined in your communication plan it'll also provide some important input to the tasks of the organization change planet will require to be successful when looking at why the change is necessary keep in mind if changes if necessary and don't most likely they don't wanna do it we need to say we need to ask yourselves for these necessary changes are there any additional tasks that need but to be added for the plan to be successful ultimately the goal of awareness is to ensure that people throughout the organize asian understand the change but also are motivated for it and the they understand not only what the end goal is but you are aligned on the organization the people in the organization wanting to achieve that goal most of the work in this phase is relates to directed communication and when communicating that's very helpful to include baseline metrics if possible so that when you're talking about improvements or any potential challenges you have already established that baseline reference point for those conversations options so the next step in ad ka as a desire and this takes a look at what are the positive and negative outcomes for individuals affected by this change it's really important for us to ask ourselves how can an employee be affected negatively by this by this change and as the ini as as not necessarily the sponsor but it's very likely the leader of the change it might be difficult for us to see the negative acts aspect we have a lot invested in this particular outcome and our successes tied to the success of the project so that's a pretty strong bias for us to assume or take the initial position that there will be no negative side effects from an employee's or a team member's perspective they might feel like they won't be needed anymore that they will no longer be an expert or that they're gonna be sidelined in some way perhaps even replaced it's really important that we empower people with information so people really want to be sought out for advice and input and we wanna make sure that we're doing that as part of our entire change management but also we keep in mind how the keep or how to maintain those kinds of relationships within the organization when when it fits when looking at desire we wanna make sure that we're doing a really good job of sharing and communicating the positive outcomes but also to be open and honest when people bring up potential negative outcomes to acknowledge them and and address them that especially if if they're identifying a gap it's it's okay change projects are very challenging and often very complex and we don't have to being an expert in everything and and and know every detail the goal is to create a desire to make the change by everyone and so when we review the organizational change you know anyone who can help us fill in gaps or identify missing parts of the plan is should be welcomed and rewarded it and when you when you're able to respond constructively with that kind of but what about or have you thought of or i think we're missing typically those people will become strong champions or at least supporters of your of the change plan so acknowledges is the next part of ad car in this step is all about ensuring that individuals have what they need to be successful that means we need to understand what is required in that means at least two things have to happen meetings with leadership need to understand to ensure that leaders of understands training and behavior changes that are gonna be necessary for the change to be successful you know beyond that meeting with everyone of who responsible we're doing the job and understand the current state very positive and i would definitely recommend that it would be best if that kind of consultation happened with their leadership in the room we wanna make sure people feel that they can be candid can talk about problems anytime there's a change you know the the part of the implicit assumption about that change the things will be better we wanna make sure that we're we can fix as many problems as possible assuming that fits not sometimes you do need to limit scope so you don't have too much scope creep but these kinds of consultations should happen early enough that ideally you could include them in scope so we also need to make sure that we clearly identify what changes need to so we understand what the work plan is going to be we wanna make sure once again that we're consulting people for two reasons without their expert knowledge and remember if if you have five people who manage your your helpdesk desk those are the leading world experts in the help desk for your organization and that you really gonna make sure you're consulting them but also by consulting them and making sure they have meaningful influence and are heard as part of the process you're really gonna find that they're gonna be much more likely to be invested in the in the change project and and help so the the second a and adc cars for ability this this phase is all about turning knowledge into action and it's not infrequent that that is a challenging thing for an organization a big change might come with lots of new skills needed so making sure that we we have an accurate understanding of our organization's ability to change a whether at the individual department or company level or anything between is quite important typically it's good to start with evaluation of individual abilities this is about talking to people doing some kind of inventory about what the the current skills are if by this point you already understand what the target skills or what the goal skills are this kind of conversation also creates an an open opportunity but any remaining gaps in the process we never want stop learning about the best way to achieve success and so at any point in the process that somebody says i think i think we're missing something that that's an important moment and we should thank them for that so additional tasks relating to this phase are all about making sure that we have the right training in place documentation in place that we have clear communication that we're also following up after training that we have the right assessments in place and then we validate that the people are actually able to do the new then that have the new abilities they need after training or whether that's self directed or external or online or or whatever it is the last part of ad card is reinforcement so you know once the change is complete it's time to move on to the next task but we often to make sure that the change is sustained metrics are a really excellent way to do this and remember that idea of starting off with baseline lines one of the ways we'll know the change is successful is by achieving metrics and then one of the ways we'll know that the that the changes has been is sustainable is once again by either maintaining or potentially growing those metrics over time another very very important point or part of reinforcement is the human side we really wanna make sure that we're recognizing the achievement of those who did the hard work of those who went to training or rack the new server or wrote the new code whatever the change is we wanna make sure that that the the heavy lifters get lots and clear recognition for that for their for their contribution to the successful project okay let's talk about the six change model the six change model focuses on sort of that well we just looked at the ic card model very focused on of the activities associate change in planning them the six change model focuses on minimizing or decreasing resistance to change so if you're an organization that has very high chain resistance then the six exchange model is typically well suited but we'll talk more about choosing a methodology later so we have these six different steps in the change model but before we dive in let's talk about the four types of change resistance according to carter and trust who provides his research there's four key things that a cause resistance to change one is self interest that we're we think that's not gonna help us a misunderstanding something about the change isn't under stood or available or is confusing and that leads to assumptions that the person is simply not very tolerant for changes that'll it'll disrupt the routine perhaps the resident expert on a subject will no longer be an expert and so they have a sense of ins insecurity with that change or diminish and then lastly different people could assess the situation differently this disagreements exist over change and what the positive or negative benefits will potentially be until we do the change no one actually knows so in any case the six change model has these six different approaches to deal with this this resistance and all aspects of the model are are dependent on or are are focused on through communication with those affected by the change in engaging with those affected to make sure that we're able to help them get on side become part of it get engaged support the change to the best of your ability so that first step is about education and communication pretty straightforward we wanna make sure everyone has the right training and education for the change we wanna make sure we communicate early and often and try to do so in a way that helps your team feels some ownership with the change we need to make sure that we talk with the team about their needs to be successful so the organization has certain goals but individuals have goals and teams have goals we gonna make sure that we're checking in with them on those things it's also very important that we do not forget to communicate why this change is important why this project is being undertaken why we're doing all this work what is the outcome and to try to get people to buy into that when we are able to do that we're able to create a unifying purpose that we've can rally around the next part of this model is the is participation involvement we wanna make sure we engage anyone affect it so that they feel connected to the change that's occurring when we have an it ideal implementation of an it project sometimes our team members can really struggle feeling not heard or they don't have any influence so while appeal is a series of best practices that it's meant to be customized on the organization we we need to make sure that our change management process is equally customized to our organization particularly the people and let us not forget that those impacted by the change are almost always part of the existing process so that's most projects there's gonna be a change of process so they have a lot of knowledge of what's working and how things seem be improve so making sure we engage those stakeholders our team members in this case early in our conversations of planning and then incorporating the feedback and demonstrating in highlighting when their feedback has been incorporated or when they've exert influence on the project can really really help provide not only with participation but increase their personal interest and engagement of being involved the next step is facilitation and support so you know we those who are doing the work of the change they they have to feel support so they need to have an s they need to know what to do when something is difficult or not going right they need to understand what their escalation path is they need to also have good clarity of what the changes and have the tools to be able to do that change there will of course be unanswered questions and uncertainty otherwise we'd be able to predict the power predict the future sorry so we need to ensure that staff aren't able to make decisions about how to what to do during this period so ideally that's about a strategic goal or a vision on a shared understanding but outcome how you achieve that but else as we just said also when when that isn't enough for them they need to understand and be supported when they choose to exercise that escalation we need to make sure that managers are well briefed and ready to support visa these kinds of change projects that we're talking about often span in many departments we're interested in breaking down silos but part of that is making sure we have good alignment with all the managers for all of the individual contributors of all the team members who are involved with the change so then we have negotiation and agreement in here this is where the participation of those effective affected is is the focus and you need to make sure that the people who are affected our stakeholder our internal stakeholders who are gonna be doing the work are given the ability to veto aspects of the change if there is a just concern this isn't because they don't like it or they don't wanna do it but if they can bring a a clear reason strong rationale and it's important that we listen to that and and give them the the opportunity to be part of green lighting the project overall so we might wanna think about those who are leading and accountable but we also wanna make sure that we're looking at the people who are actually doing the work but also understand the work and the value we're delivering to our consumers to our customers through this whatever service or product that we're that will be affected by the change one of the really great parts or a good success signal when using negotiation agreement is when you empower someone or you give them influence they the faith that they can have effect often they will become supportive more previously they they expressed concerned or we're actively against the change well we wanna make sure that we don't reward behavior for being difficult wanna thank them for their contribution to make sure we support the constructive and positive part of that interaction there's two reasons for that we we don't wanna reward the wrong behavior when we don't wanna incentivize the wrong behavior but also it can be very demo moral for the other team members who are being supportive to see someone who wasn't acting that would be rewarded for that behavior so now we move on to what happens when you're not able to get people on side when we've talked to them they're still not interested or they throw up a a barrier at every turn well then we start looking at manipulation and c option so what we wanna do is wanna try to give people who resist and potentially their leader into the project team this can help give them a voice where we can you know potentially do good work with that although honestly if if it they won't able to provide that outside of the team and it's not super likely it also helps us contain the that resistance when we do this we need to make sure that we're being authentic and real hey i i i i get that you're not a a big fan of i you've got some significant concerns about this would you be interested in being part of the team to to better articulate that we really appreciate your input we really wanna get you to a point where you can support it's the kinda language we're looking for we always wanna on act integrity although an important part of management is discretion as well it could even be a useful strategy to give the resistor a a task of substantial importance that could help their identification of ownership with the project but also give them a a a greater sense of importance and influence around this change which can be a very effective and to antidote if they're feeling sidelined or diminished by the change we wanna make sure in these kinds of situations that we work directly with them one on one to ensure that they're on the right track and that we're seeing the right kind of progress and that they have the correct support to be or the necessary support to be successful and then our last step of the six 6s model is explicit and implicit conversion there are some people who just aren't gonna get on onboard so we need to be very clear that you know change resistance will have a negative result that could be of negative performance review a lack of a annual bonus or a lack of arrays of potentially even termination if you're for instance if we're adding jira to our company and somebody hates jira end simply will not accept it well ultimately we're not going to make it we're not gonna roll back that decision because one person doesn't like it if they're not able to provide a clear coherent well supported rational argument for why we shouldn't do it then ultimately they need to accept it or it won't be the right fit in this organization we we don't wanna exercise this this kind of of technique if we don't need to it's typically only really necessary when rapid change is required or if there's extreme resistance typically over time with the right support cheer leading you're gonna get people on side and using this approach is not negate trying other methods first if i would definitely see this as the option of last resort we wanna make sure that we've fully exercised reviewed and implemented all the other techniques that we've talked about so far when we have these kinds of conversations though we do need to be very clear if there's gonna be a consequence such as no bonus or whatever it is we need to be clear and explicit we also need to do that in a discreet way and that and it would be the job of the manager to have that conversation potentially you un and the direct reports manager we need to also involve our human resources or people and culture team to be explicit into document the requirements for those affected along with the outcome of what what happened ideally success okay let's take a look at the freeze change models is a relatively simple one three steps this is a developed by kurt lu in nineteen forty seven based the idea that the majority of people live and work in their comfort zone and they're a little bit like a block of ice and so they need motivation to leave their comfort zone as they're not gonna be able to make a change until they're uncomfortable so for that tension curve occur the ice has to un phrase change and then froze frozen again so let's talk about that first step un freezing that's in this stage there's a lots of analysis and communication and the analysis completed determines that there's a need to change with an it initiative we'll probably you talk about things like increase customer demands and improve resilience competitive advantage in technology shrinking funding those kinds of things aside for completing the analysis this state also needs to prepare the organization for chains that could be sharing the need sharing the urgency talking about the impact if we don't do the change preparing the organization for a change is in the end about selling the idea of the change and getting the organization to accept it it's an opportunity to build momentum create awareness about why this change is necessary urgent and the positive outcomes of achieving the change and the negative outcomes if we do not achieving the change it's this is also our the first opportunity to engage people so that they feel they have a voice in what's occurring we say feel we don't mean just feel they have to actually authentically have a voice and they need to feel that they have a voice but so then step two of course is change in this stage people are correctly impacted of course so lots of engagement coaching training and three location these are all the kinds of activities we need to be doing during this phase we know what the end state is as as we have already sold people on that the this right now is building the path from our current state to that desired end state this is all about project plans our organizational change plans communication plans all those kinds of things they're gonna be developed and implemented during the change stage so there's a couple of key things that we wanna do we wanna make sure we're engaging new leaders managers and staff and the changes reinforcing the required change and this is where you wanna bring in the metrics and performance goals so there's a number of different techniques associated the change phase you can see them all in the book i'm gonna really focus on what i believe is the most important one and that's emotional safety they don't use that exact term in the book they talk about providing a safe environment for questions and making the mistakes you'll notice that this is something in common with ad car as well the reaction of leadership and staff ask about why are we doing this or or how are we going to achieve change is gonna play a huge role in how staff feel about that change if it's those questions are welcomed and they're included and we demonstrate that we're that we're thinking about how those change will affect not only your customers not only our budget but also our team then we're gonna be much more likely chance of getting them on sign and supporting the change and of course as we're doing the change mistakes are to get are are gonna occur so assuming that mistake was made in good faith then we need to learn from mistake acknowledge and thank them for trying their best and then ideally use that mistake as an example for everyone else involved in the change and then lastly once we've achieved the change people need to get comfortable with that and so now we're at the freezing stage this is when things become reno normalized and of the desired end state that new state becomes states enters a steady state or becomes stable this in the world of it could be relatively short change as many organizations have a very high of change but still that that doesn't mean that we don't need to pay attention to normalizing the change we wanna see metrics stabilize potentially grow or become more efficient over time this sounds a lot like that sustainability in in ad car and the reinforcement step when the projects over then we now shift this to operations there's from project to service baking the the new service or whatever the new change new product new process baking these metrics into performance objectives for teams departments and and indeed individuals is an excellent way to normalize this kind of behavior and don't forget to celebrate achieving success we achieve that desired end result that new state that we wanna have a big celebration so the team understands that their hard work it's appreciated and particularly that we identify how the team helped influence it about things like identifying gaps and things like that to to achieve success so the next model we're to look at is the mckinsey seven of the sort mckinsey seven s this was introduced by tom peters and of at water and the eighty four who are for the world famous as mckinsey company and this is a very comprehensive model that's intended to assess or diagnose the current state organization compare that state to the desired state and identify gaps and that you may then create a plan to address those gaps the core idea is that for change be successful the seven areas addressed here need to be properly aligned with the results in each element to reinforce the other six so they're all interdependent this is often used as the strategic level tool for planning it tool initiatives potentially it it's beneficial to use this in combination that hybrid model with other tools or other model sorry that will help pick up the work on being more employee focused you'll see this one is not particularly employee focused this is a a very good case of where these models are iterative throughout the life cycle of the project each element all seven of these need to be periodically evaluated but let us be clear that shared values are central to all the other elements of the model and if during a project or change the shared values of an organization change it will be repercussions throughout the organization and this whatever change you're working on so the first s is strategy this is the plan to achieve the the vision and meet the require overall objectives we wanna make sure that we're this is really the time to look very carefully to current state but also in the context of what's happening the market or overall environment we talk environment really talking about jurisdictions and government regulations and things like that and we need to ask ourselves how do we need to evolve to remain relevant or obtain a competitive advantage and then what's the timing for that this likely will take or require in strategy vision sessions you wanna make sure we have key internal experts in involved with this but often this kind of activity is done by leadership when we are identifying the strategy envision we really wanna make sure that we're whether that we're well articulating the desired and state and that we articulate what will it take to be successful or are the potential obstacles what are guiding principles who are key stakeholders and project participants so the next asset is structure every organization has an organizational structure here the organizational chart and leadership structures evaluated to ensure or understand that does the existing structure of our organization meet the needs once the required to require to achieve the intended change and to sustain that change it's not uncommon to see the structure of our organization change due to a very large it project for example new department i'd be created when true problem management is deploy permanent governance instructors may be established like a change advisory board or a finance control group to ensure funds are allocated for of developing and creating services that are gonna provide the best value for the business next we'll take a look at systems we wanna think of systems as policies processes and procedures used by an organization to complete their day to day activities so we wanna evaluate how we do work today today to help us understand not only why are we doing it that way but what changes do we need to make these process is for our outcome to be successful we wanna make sure we spend quite a bit of time existing the evaluating the existing state and understanding how to connect the dots doing a gap analysis on what will be needed to achieve the new state so for example if we wanna introduce continued improvement to the organization as part of the change and we need to understand and evaluate sas what what we'll need to do to get to there from here we could potentially publish share metrics we could in provide incentives for proven suggestions and outcomes we could come up with new objectives for how we assess performance and we could have a routine that focuses on improvement initiatives or discussion groups so next we'll talk about shared values let's keep in mind that this is very much the heart of the mckinsey seven s model and we need to ensure that we're re evaluating our share shared values as part of any major change if the values are not documented then we do need to make sure that we document them at least for the it division or if not the entire company and then we wanna ensure that we've documented and share those core values throughout the organization to make sure that they are truly share values you don't if you don't communicate them then of course you you're very difficult for them to be shared so we wanna make sure that these different values are informing the work because it will affect every single of the part of the seven s's it is to be to be realistic sometimes public publicized shared values or even documenting or changing them won't be successful due to the politics of an organization therefore we just have to accept it out of scope even the formal work doesn't allow for this we still wanna try to do our best to communicate and bake this into our change project it's communication with staff members that certain behavior are valued by the project and subsequently the it organization can still influence the assured value of the organizations even if it's in a more organic and less formal way next we'll look at skills this is very reminiscent of abilities in the ad car model we wanna understand that we take a look at the and this is where we see the most formality about a timeline we wanna understand what is the desired state what is the journey and then what skills exist but you'll notice that it instead of starting with existing state like we talked about in the other steps of the mckinsey seven s here we wanna start with a desired state what skills are required to maintain and continuously improve again result so then what skills do we need for the journey and then and then that gives you a total inventory of all scales that are needed now and we do take a look and assess our existing skills we're able to easily understand the full gap if any may exist and almost certainly there will will be some that are needed for the project change project is successful and then lastly we talked about style oops right style and then one more so when we call style is really the leadership style what kind of behaviors does leadership exhibit are the leaders in the organization successful there a strong sense of teamwork collaboration or is it silos that are almost like different organizations that sometimes work with junk we wanna make sure that we're taking our understanding or assessment or analysis of the leadership style of the organization in using that to create the biggest chance for success of the change how can we leverage the existing style to benefit this project and the change that we're that we're seeking so if we have a collaborative style then we can look at things like focus groups or gathering feedback to the surveys if we don't then we might have to look at alternatives ideally you'll need a strong executive sponsor who's able to dictate that some of that information is provide ultimately we wanna make sure that we understand the style of key individuals that are influential for the change project and that we're able to use those to the best ability of our team to be successful with the change so lastly we have staff i prefer the word team but then that wouldn't fit with the seven s's so the staff part of mckinsey seven s model relates to understanding what what does our team what does the staff need to be successful this is about competencies that skills is about organizational structure structure and that staff are prepared to take on the new responsibilities so this is another one another part of the model it's relatively easy to see how it connects and it's interdependent with all of the other parts so we wanna ask ourselves what who who do we have on the team are there any distinctive qualities is it important to consider any staff or roles that are pertinent to the project if if we have an effective team that is outsourced or is going to be outsourced with the very relevant detail that we considered and not only so like we're adding a team that's outsourced people and if the first team people probably would be nervous of more outsourcing if we're losing a team to outsourcing then are we exiting those people who you have it function are we finding them new roles and ideally more exciting or more fulfilling roles okay let's take a look at carter's eighth step so the eight step model was changed by john carter nineteen ninety six and its focus on building employee support and understanding with while at the same time strengthening change and accountability we wanna ensure that we're bringing this model early in the ideal project usually in the initiation stage i think that's that's pretty good advice for all of these models this really isn't a good one that you can bring to the game linked there are eight key elements of of this or eight key steps i use some short terms here so i'll i'll take some time to read the full language from carter's eight step model that's establishing a sense of urgency creating a guiding coalition developing a vision and strategy communicating the change empowering broad based action creating short term wins consolidating gains and producing more change and anchoring new approaches in the culture so i think you can probably start to see quite a bit of similarity and that would give you a good sense of the the the key requirements for any kind of change model to be successful let's take a look at that first one establishing a sense of urgency this element of the model is the basis for the purpose of the project and what needs to be communicated this communication includes why the project needs happen and sells the benefits the employees let's also keep in mind you wanna also articulate the cost if you don't undertake the change the purpose of this step is to convince employees to persuade the team that it's in their best in and that it's in the best interest of the company therefore themselves to make this change the the established sense of urgency really ties to the strong focus on accountability of this model and that we can lay the groundwork for that accountability with these early stages we also in addition to selling the changes or persuading people of the of the benefit of the changes we also wanna identify the consequences of not changing we wanna do this in the short and long long term what's the impact of the company division department or even the employee the change doesn't occur next is guiding a creating create a guiding coalition so for there to be clear accountability we need to have lines of authorities and cleared boundaries for example if changes are occurring to operating level agreements the responsible team are not responding appropriately who owns the issue is it the service level manager or the line manager who who's accountability for employees changing the behavior who's measuring on the success of of that change when we're determining the lines of authority boundaries it's important to consider alone the success of a particular aspect of the project and who's responsible for supporting the team members to ensure that they have a clear understanding of what is required of them how to do it and leave the tools to be successful the next part of this model is to develop a vision and strategy we need to make sure that the the vision connects with the overall help of the company the division can the employee once the end state is defined in the project team along of course with leadership will determine the necessary steps to achieve the end state vision let me really clear that in in the connor model we're talking for vision and strategy for the change itself so there's two different ways that we could the two different approaches we could take care the first that's taking the end state for the overall initiative and defining the organizational changes that are we're we're gonna own there we go and defining so the first is to take the end stage for the for the change project and then define the organizational changes that we're gonna need to be able to achieve that end stage and ensuring that we identify all the tasks that are gonna needed to get to that end state and the second thing we can do is to identify the end state vision for the organizational change so will talk more about the overall for example desired end state might be that we would embrace process and continue improvement once the nsa vision is determined then the behavior changes is necessary to support the end state can be identified and that we can go from there i i really don't think we wanna change choose one or the other not only do i think both have their strengths and weaknesses and they strongly complement each other but also these two different approaches will be received positively by different kinds of people and this gives you a better opportunity making sure that you're engaging and and that the change the value of the change and the vision the change and the purpose of the change is resonating with as many people in your organization as possible next we have communicate the change vision so now that we have that vision we need to make sure everyone understands it so depending on the size of your company leaders might be involved in in defining vision vision but we definitely want to communicate to the vision up to leadership at the highest possible level and ideally we create a leadership this some of the communication that really helps demonstrate buying in throughout throughout their organization particularly from from those leading organizations when we're communicating the vision to leadership we might wanna look at one on one sessions with two leaders or with department heads the part of the leadership conversation is to to make sure that the leaders understand the vision of the change and to enable them to be able to effectively support and manage conversations when their team members or anyone the organization comes to them with a question or concern about the change project once you've established the trip now we're ready to broadly communicate throughout the we wanna focus on that value proposition of the vision for the company division department and for the individual contributors or our team members we wanna make sure that we're including the reasoning or the rationale for the change and don't forget we wanna make sure we're communicating the negative outcome if we don't undertake this change once again including leadership in this communication is a is a very strong strategy so next we have the idea for the step of to empower broad based action we need to make sure that individuals are able to feel safe and undertake this work whenever we ask people to change they need to get out of the comfort zone they're gonna have to try to do things and when you try to do new things you're gonna make mistakes we need to ensure that we have a safe environment to discuss failures or aspects of the change that didn't go as planned maybe people was an failure but we still doesn't necessarily mean that we achieve success and especially we need to celebrate the discussions regarding challenges by public publicized initial setbacks and plans to continue for momentum so this definitely resonates with other models that we've talked about but i particularly like about this is it is that this assumes really the all this the connor method definitely truly explicitly assumes that we're not going to be successful on our initial timeline there's gonna be things that we don't understand or we're not able to predict and we need to be prepared for those things we also need to ensure that we're focusing on or understanding who's resistant to our changes and ensure that we can minimize the the the their impact from the team of the project we wanna publicly privately make sure that we're rewarding and and thanking those who are embracing the change in keep in mind that recognition can happen in many many ways it doesn't have to be monetary only we need to make sure that we're holding people accountable for achieving the there or of being successful in the task so they're assigned as part of this change also providing support to the overall project for the connor model accountability for the change is is at the it's very hard celebrating a spirit of learning progress but also quickly act when finger pointing or blame new curves that's really not how we're going to be successful with driving significant organization change the next snap is to create short term wins so we want to establish both short and long term move but you know every project is gonna have some short term lengths and you know tool we're probably gonna find those things domains like instant management or request to fulfillment and problem management although they you're certainly not limited to that so this is an important point especially for it organizational changes to establish those baseline metrics and then establish the goals we could that then when we are able to achieve those shorter term wins based on metrics we're now able to share and communicate those success stories by sharing those tangible metric based achievements but also don't forget to talk about in intangible progress like customer enthusiasm or a team member excitement or someone who used to be be post the change when has now come around and is an enthusiastic supporter don't forget that about long term goals as well those are gonna be significant milestones to any journey of improvement in any organizational change we wanna be ensuring that we are promoting and sharing those stories as well and metrics can be very helpful there as well in so then we go to consolidate gains and produce more change so here we wanna improve the short term wins the short term wins so we wanna identify who on the teams making substantial contributions of the change and how to help them be more influential and what ideas they have and and the team can come up with to continue improving on the existing changes we wanna make sure that we're winning persistence dedication and creative thinking so we could look at corporate reward systems but also you could look at unique project related reward opportunities we wanna ensure that we're we have complete lessons learned for that for difficult aspects of the change and then as quickly as possible adapt our process of the change of the organizational change to incorporate those lessons learned so that we reduce pain and improve efficiency and hopefully happiness for everyone else involved not only in this project but in future chain management projects as well and then we wanna in particular make sure that we're valuing acknowledging rewarding when changes are becoming operationalize and we we see them hit that steady state and then that brings us to anchor new approaches in the culture so this is the final step we wanna anchor the changes within the company culture so now the outcomes have been achieved we wanna make sure that they get embedded so that they're gonna be state this is accomplished by doing things like updating company values practices and policies we also need to make sure that we're reassess corporate metrics to make sure that the new results are included but potentially how we measure or what we measure needs to be updated as well from an it perspective things like service level targets service level agreements contracts service costs our service catalog policies objectives can all be updated signed off and published we also wanna make sure once again thinking about accountability that we're reinforcing the accountability for the change and our continual improvement including how we evaluate employee performance based on the outcome of this change and the metrics that we're measuring we can have a very strong impact and ensure that we're baking in the right kind of incentives for our team to make sure we're anchoring this change so that it's gonna be successful on the long term and so let's us just go back to these five different change models add cards exchange freeze change mckinsey seven s and carter eight step keep in mind that's selecting a model in incorporating the core concepts we'll reduce the potential challenges for any organizational change project in being successful wanna ensure that we plan identify key roles and the requirements of change the course skills and everything and all the resources needed and that puts us in a very nice position to change summarize the different change models but also prepare for the last unit at the last topic of this unit change model success
Unit 10 - Topic 3.webm: okay so let's take a look at change model success successful change depends on a correct approach to the structure of the change and an effective accountability process us please note that i say a correct and ineffective in this definition because there's almost never only one single correct option to determine the right change model for a project when you take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of all the options while considering the context of the change in the organization keep in mind that every model is gonna have strengths and weaknesses pros and cons so we need to evaluate those models based on what is needed the organization those strengths and weaknesses are gonna be based on your assessment certainly the author of our book has a certain opinion but you know we are gonna bring their own critical skills to this and need that needs to intersect with the needs of our organization and the change we really can't underestimate how important it is to include the need of the project in the calculation of or selection of a change model we need to look at what the changes are and what extent of changes being intended regarding our people our processes and our technologies and then equally importantly is to look at our leadership philosophy and organizational the organizational strengths and also understanding you know what are our resources is that includes people time money and any of the things that we have organization at our disposal the author really supports or the book really talks very positively what using the hybrid model to address change in organizations since one no one model does a perfect job of managing all aspects of a change i wanna be really clear that i i i don't disagree with that but i also think there are lots of places where one model would work and that what the author doesn't really address is the complexity of how one or more additional change models increase the dependencies the complexity the thinking and all the intersections of all the aspects have already a very complex project so i would provide a a moderating position to the author that don't assume you need a hybrid model see if you see if one of the change models we've looked at or there aren't many others one of those change models suits the need before you dive into trying to create a hybrid of two or more models for your change as looking at making a decision around which change model we should select you know we definitely need to look at the benefits and disadvantages and we also need to look at the the cost change or sorry of the decision of not using so we wanna make sure that we're clearly looking at both what is the outcome of using this one and what is the outcome of not using these other ones i would also say that there's a lot to be set which isn't mentioned in our book for what has our organization done in the past now with we're a situation where not no formal change model has been used then yeah you have a bit of a luxury but also a very difficult task of trying to identify the best model for your organization but i would put a lot of weight on the previous experience especially if it's been positive and successful so what we'll do now is talk a little bit about the best case scenarios or the strengths weaknesses of each of the models that we just explored and discussed add cards relatively easy to use in but also brings quite a bit of comprehensive planning in structure but it's prepare for ideal process changes so definitely has a strong communication component from the very beginning of the project through implementation when you use add car we you're gonna end up or need a focus on ensuring employees are successful the goal and have adequate planning for both the knowledge and ability of staff members and the reinforcement activities really help address how to sustain that change at car fits for a size of any change but really focuses on a data identifying the task necessary to support support employees it doesn't do as nearly as well and addressing a strategy for achieving design outcome the six change model has some planning components also begins to bring in some resistance to change dimensions to it as well we it's one of the very few ones that really openly and clearly takes a look at harder situations such as those that could require manipulation and c corruption and explicit and implicit coercion it has an excellent focus on managing resistance so if the organize if you expect there to be significant resistance to a particular change or if the organization as a whole has a low tolerance per change then six change model has a lot to offer it also splits focus between planning and techniques to implement change so we need to make sure that there's enough invested in determining the the steps necessary to achieve the desired outcome change as the model includes three planning related focus areas use of this model sometimes is going to need an extra effort to place the right amount of emphasis on execution the freeze change model is is the simplest and really focuses on taking employees out of their comfort zone which is the very definition of every change this model relies heavily in leadership has taking people out of the comfort zone can often create significant churn by churn mean people changing departments or leaving the organization really looking for the guidance support of trusted leaders that's necessarily c suite or executives but often that is the case very simple model but it does have some weakness around in debt planning this is an excellent choice to spark innovation and you may wanna look at a different model to plan for the execution or implementation of the change mckinsey seven s model is exhaustive it's probably the highest level in most strategic and it really emphasizes understanding the strategy but also the strength of weaknesses is team and puts a really important emphasis on shared values that strongly differentiates it from the other options each component of the mckinsey seven s that's model builds on the next allowing for very comprehensive planning it's bears repeating that shared values really sits at the center of this both literally in terms of your steps but also favorably in terms of of the dependencies and inter dependencies of all the steps of the mckinsey seven model so you want to make sure that your tactics your plans even your strategy needs to be considered or how to influence the emotional and rational aspects of this change and if there are any changes to the shared value during the project on how you'll need to update and adapt to that change and then lastly we have carter's eight step this model focuses on acceptance and preparation for change and continual improvement it's a very easy to understand model and has some really great benefits for the awareness focus on urgency accountability vision and empowerment one of its best strengths is around a court accountability it's a very strong focus in the early steps so it's very good to think about the culture of your organization you're really gonna need a strong cohesive management team to effectively achieve desired result if you're gonna use the quarter model however when applying the model how to influence attitudes and behaviors during execution are less easy if we identify challenges or gaps with with those steps of a change organizational change then we might wanna look at ad card or six change to improve how we're analyzing assessing and identifying tasks which can improve influence adoption so that is a summary of how to choose or the relative strengths and weaknesses of a particular of the different model that we looked at now the last chapter that we look at is accountability and and the it's very intentionally included with deciding on or choosing a organizational change model because without a accountability you can't be successful and i i also believe without employing a change management planning of significantly diminished a chances of success so regardless of which method you choose we we have to be really focused on how important accountability is we don't have visible accountability then i'd best will have partial success and at worst will just simply fail so let's think about what accountability means the book has an interesting questions how do you how do you define accountability how do you hold people accountable what does it mean to hold some accountable are you accountable an accountable person no when we talk about the functional dimension of accountability you know typically the sponsor is gonna be ultimately accountable for the outcome for the result that doesn't mean that project participants are not existent or don't have some kind of responsibility or some partial accountability and they may even be responsible for task completion day to day but ultimately who is accountable for the success or failure of the project but you know i i wanna make sure we're being really clear on what being accountable means that the book doesn't really define or talk much about behaviors that needed to be so here's a list of of eight different things i think each are very important need to make sure that we're taking responsibility that we we don't make excuses now that we keep our commitment and that can be as simple as being on time we we don't want to blame other people we don't wanna take on the attitude of the victim instead we wanna ask what can i do we need to make sure we own our feelings we manage expectations so that we are being clear on what we are going to do what we can do and that when things change that we follow up with people so they understand what the new expectation should be to make sure we collaborate no one can be successful in an organization by working on their own we need to do this not for the praise so doesn't praise isn't very important but we need to be focused on our own personal gratification coming from a job well done and and can do him our best and i wonder i think we've all had the experience of meeting someone who blames other people for all anything that goes wrong might be described as someone who's who's a victim i really like this quote in the image here when you blame others you give up your power to change because if you're not responsible for the outcome then how can you possibly change the outcome we wanna make sure that we are accountable we also wanna help and support the people we work with to shift out of that victim mentality into an accountable mentality i think this is a very important part of individual or personal leadership and there's one very simple way to help people shift out of that and even to check in with yourself it's actually on this list let's asked what can i do so let's let's talk a little a little bit more how do you foster accountability well it it starts with you are you accountable when was the last time someone didn't go right maybe in this course in your proof work could you blame others or did you take responsibility what did you learn from the experience asking the when you face a problem or when you make a the mistake or an outcome is not successful and there's a failures kind the most important question can ask is what can i do approach this and really we focus on that another very important part of accountability is apologizing and i i think it's worth taking just a moment to ensure that we're all clear that there's three parts to apology have to say that we're done i'm sorry we have to that accept responsibility i'm i'm sorry this happened if it's my fault what can i do to make it right simple not necessarily easy to be very difficult and emotional challenging thing to do but not only is this an important way to interact with your colleagues and i would say have everyone in life but also modeling this especially in front of other people is extremely important because a very powerful kind of personal leadership a huge part of accountability is learning from experience when something doesn't go as planned where the outcome isn't as doesn't necessarily fail but not as expected we wanna make sure that we acted retro and we look back on it but we also wanna understand who can contributed to the issue and did we contribute to the issue that did you have some accountability here whether it was failing problem or not communicate not communicating a political step there's always an opportunity to learn we don't wanna just identify the problem i always make sure we're going a step further ask how did we contribute the problem more particularly how how did i can choose problem and really approach question with an emphasis on learning rather than blaming it's really powerful how much insight we can achieve by doing this and really helps you avoid making the same stake so that was a little that that part really talked about how to do personal reflection but as a project or a change service leader you're you're gonna need to hold other people accountable as well and so instead of saying something like what went wrong or service why did you fail we wanna ask a question thing closer to like what did you learn from what happened if we can start a conversation not with blaming others but saying something like i understand others contributed to the issue but how could you have changed the outcome this could be a very powerful way and well can really help stop blaming and shift the focus back onto to how do we continually improve how do we continually learn that learning experience really comes down to asking why if you're you're familiar with the five y that's that's where this not maybe not it comes from it's closely lined with from from the toyota production system you know if we wanna just simply shift a conversation one step to get it to be about accountability then we can just talk about you know we need to make sure we're taking the time to understand what motivates people and and that's a wide question no know most people have good intentions but you know emotions relating me their experience and beliefs are gonna end up part of their behavior and the emotions can be very complicated so we wanna ask you know a question start with who one but wanna keep on using that y question to you get to the belief and understand the emotion another way of looking at that it wanna keep asking why until you get to the root cause five wise series if you ask why five times that you'll probably get there i'd really appreciate the book takes a look at or the book mentions emotional intelligence something i've mentioned i think it's a very very important skill and the the book talks about some examples it's really important that when it's time to have an accountability conversation that we we have them the longer delay them worse the problems we get and almost always you wish that you had that that accountability conversation earlier this is a lesson very hard to because right before having accountability conversation with someone it it feels difficult and challenging i'm very unpleasant it doesn't mean to be confrontational though as we said we could use these y questions but we also need to make sure that if need to talk about consequences or negative outcomes performance improvement that were clear and explicit and that we support that team member in having the things they need to get successful within that plan and they we may still make decisions or choices that end up leading to to not being six successful but that we would do everything we can to support them when we talk about accountability we definitely need to talk about managing up in fact as a project leader you'll have to automatic upwards sound sideways and downwards every direction of the organization because that we're not gonna be limited by silos we're gonna be focus on cheating the outcome and and doing the work wherever need that wherever it needs to happen but definitely part of this is that you might have to have a hard conversation with someone who has a high your rank in you and the organization or perhaps just as hardy close peer something that you're friends with or have a long term your deep relationship with you even if it is purely professional so the our book talks about four key steps to have those con con kinds of conversations schedule the conversation plan the plan the conversation and plan the closing so we see they have a very clear focus on the plan part of this so in terms of scheduling conversation in terms of scheduling the conversations can be quite hard by scheduled the conversation you're making a commitment to having the conversation and and you can't i i really wouldn't say that you need to be secretive or coy about you you need to say hey boss i need to have conversation about some accountability issues and i think it's gonna be a tough conversation but i wanna make sure that we get on the calendar and that we're able to have it as as possible the we need to for yourself be clear what the intended outcome is don't go into that meeting to without a clear idea of what a successful meeting would look like a successful conversation are you just looking to vent hey boss when you did this i felt thanks for hearing me are you looking for changing of behavior hey boss when you do this it creates this kind of problem and i would like to discuss with you or would you be willing to make this a change to you need certain activity achieve by a certain date if you don't go into this kind of conversation knowing what us success look like knowing what your outcomes is gonna look like very unlikely that you'll be successful obviously we're seeing a lot of parallels this is kind of thing if this is a micro project yeah for yourself before you have the conversation you wanna outline the conversation you really wanna take some notes here where do you wanna talk about what are the examples having specific examples can be very very helpful and making sure that you've done your homework or preparation at the time it's something that's critical to that being successful and then you really wanna know how are you gonna close and and how are you going to state the expectations for the future if you're asking for them to complete a task are are they clear what the task is have you both agreed on on a due date you wanna change your behavior would it make sense to schedule a follow conversation to talk about progress and if it makes sense at the end thanking the person for taking the time to talk with you and having what may have been an awkward discussion is a really a great way to wrap that up and that is the end of our topic and the end of unit ten so please look forward to your questions you have for for me on any of the material in unit ten
Unit 2 - Intro & Getting Started with OOL.webm: hi there and welcome back this is professor y with the beginning of unit two understanding project management in this unit we'll start looking deeply at project management in the pm box our key concepts are to be introduced to project management that includes the key concepts ethics and professional conduct and the roles when you're when you've completed this unit you will be able to describe the key concepts of project management apply the ethical and professional conduct of project management and describe the project management roles we have three topics in this unit project management key concepts ethics and roles as we begin to more closely examine project management please keep in mind that this is not a certification course for pm p or for it this is a graduate level introductory course so that means you'll leave this course with the strong understanding and ability to work with pm p practices and it teams and and assignments in the workplace that have those requirements so in this video we'll be looking at project management key concepts so that's unit two point one so what are those key concepts well there's seven of them defining projects the purpose of projects benefits life cycles project processes and knowledge organizational project management that all comes from the pm box but there's one other thing that i wanna focus on make sure that you're aware of as we get started and that's the idea of the triple constraint the resources for this unit are the required one is just the pm ba guide looking at park one point one the introduction in one point two the environment in which projects operate the pm box guide is the canonical source for all of for the pm project management institutes pm bach formally that meant the project management body of knowledge but now just referred to as the pm box this is an ebook it's required for this course it's available to you on the website o'reilly online learning and it's available at no fee so please be sure to get access to this resource as soon as possible so that i can get you help if if you're having trouble okay so this is a very important step you will not be successful in this course if you don't have access to this book so i wanna talk a little bit about o'reilly online learning this is one of my favorite all time tools for online leaning resources i've been a subscriber myself for more than a decade and in its previous incarnation called safari i've been using this online service for almost twenty years i've got certifications through it my bread countless books and taken courses attended webinars it's a it's a really fantastic resource in my opinion it has some of the absolute best quality tech learning resources out there if you're not familiar with o'reilly i i encourage you to investigate their catalog they've been around for a very long time and to me set the standard for what a technical press should be among the really great things about it being an online service now of courses is that is being constantly updated and that we have a site license so it's free to use for all cones yoga students i want you i want to make sure you're clear that all required materials for this course are on o'reilly online learning so that you get the latest greatest and don't have to buy textbooks that'll quickly go out to date so i hope that works for you please let me know if you have any trouble getting access to this resource because it's so important to this course i'm gonna spend a little bit of time making sure that we take a look at exactly how to do that you just need to go to the website or o'reilly dot com i have a little walk through video that i made here i've also made this video available as part of the course in unit two once you go there you just need to sign in with your cones email address once you put in that it'll recognize the fact that it's a a subscribed account and allow you to sign in with single sign on so it'll just take you here you just need to log in as you normally do with your cones account once you've done that you'll be able to log in and find all the resources please explore and have fun finding all the amazing stuff that's on here but for this unit we are looking for that pm ba guide and once you find it then you'll be able to start reading it and follow along and and do the reading that's required for the course as i said that little walk through video is available as a standalone video on know in the unit two course unit section there is no audio i didn't think that it was necessary thought was pretty self explanatory so i did this one for you so once again if you have any trouble just let me know okay so next we have defining projects
Unit 2.1 - Topic 1 - Defining Projects.webm: so next we'll take a look at defining projects so before we do that actually let's talk a little bit about defining the the pm box so i we've mentioned this several times already but the project management has an authoritative standard and it's published by the pm that's the project management institute and it's known as the pm embark or pe embark guide and the guide according to itself identifies a subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as good practice so it's actually a lot going on there one of the things that i think you'll note or at least that i see in the project management in the pe box is that it they work very hard to be highly applicable to any industry and any situation i think sometimes there are definitions are pretty tough and they're not super useful but they are highly applicable to lots of situations so i think that's a good thing overall and when things aren't clear i'll i'll try to do my best to help make them more clear and of course please ask questions anytime you don't understand what some of these definitions meaning anything else about the course at all i wanna talk touch on two things in that definition that generally recognized and the good practice so when we say generally recognized here this means that the knowledge and practice is described are applicable to most projects most of the time and there's a can sense is about their value and their usefulness notice that it's not everyone it's not it's not perfect and it's not absolute and then we talk about good practices here and a good practice means that there's a general agreement that the application of this knowledge or skill tool or technique to project management will typically enhance the chances of success over many projects and delivering the expected value and results that's one of those big long definitions that maybe isn't the easiest or the the clearest but it means that you know what it's typically does a better job than than not and we've seen that proven repeatedly this sort of brings us back to our previous lecture when i was talking about best practices and that they're they're the best that we have not the best that exist and this is the same kind of thing also you'll see that in the generally recognized last lecture we talked about how the pm p doesn't or the pin box or does not specify things that must be used in every situation in every project but that you know it's a list of practices that you can choose to use alright so with that taking care of so how do we define a project well we talked a little bit we touched on this a little bit in our last lecture you know it's a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product service or result once again that's a very broad definition so it can be applied pretty much anywhere so let's take a look at a closer look at this going beyond our previous exploration of what a project is so i think it's really important to think a lot about how projects are unique what does that mean it means that you know that that there it hasn't been done before in this exact wave or for this exact reason you know all projects have a deliverable it's some sort of objective and once achieved then it will be done the the way that you do that and why you do that the how those are all where we find the uniqueness of projects alright it's important to understand that that uniqueness can be in some way repetitive so you know a some kind of repetition or repetitive elements may be present in some project deliverables and activities that doesn't change the fact that they're unique for example an office building can be constructed with the same or similar materials or by the same or teams however each building project remains unique and key characteristics such as location design environment situation people involved in things like that the other thing to take a look at is that projects are temporary so projects have a beginning and an end so temporary doesn't mean that they're short necessarily you many projects spanned years and years there's such as you know u launching a rocket to the moon or building a commercially successful electric car those kinds of projects can span years of potentially even the decades yet they're still in an important way temporary so given the fact that projects have a beginning in an end it's very important to consider how how we know when they're done well projects and when the objectives have been achieved or the objective cannot or will not be met you run out of resources there's no longer a need for the project the people or resources are just no longer available or it's been terminated for legal cause or convenience so i mean that that's a very exhaustive list a lot of those don't happen often but basically you know when a project has either been successful or cannot be successful then typically that project is finished and that is defining a project next we'll look at the purpose of projects
Unit 2.1 - Topic 2 - The Purpose of Projects.webm: next we'll take a look at the purpose of projects so all projects broadly speaking have two purposes to drive change and to create the value and all projects have cost and time energy and resources and in addition to that project management it's itself has costs in terms of time energy and resources so it's critical that we use these tech techniques of project management only when it's worth it it's equally important to tailor our project management techniques and processes to fit the outcomes that we're looking for we'll talk a little bit more about tailoring later in this unit so let's talk about how projects drive change if there's no desired change and there's no need for a project project is always always about what kind of change do we wanna affect and then why and how and oh is it going be worth it if if there's enough resources then the project isn't viable by resources i mean things like time money and energy or people and if there isn't enough value to the project that it also isn't viable you know keep in mind every project is an investment successful projects have sufficient roi return on an investment that isn't always easier easy to measure so that we need to look at both how do products drive change or what is the change that that project is intended to accomplish but also how will the project create value so this graph comes from an article from the pm on that's called the delivering business value is the most important aspect of project management both not entirely sure i agree with that but i think that's a it's a very def def claimant certainly makes a lot of sense and i think a lot of a lot of people would agree with that in the project management industry but let's take a step back and ask ourselves what is value so value is the net quantifiable benefit derived from a business endeavor the benefit may be tangible intangible or both again that one these very broad definitions so you know you know a value is some kind of benefit this diagram here shows the different steps and how you would achieve that the i i really wanna focus here on that step five it's really important that you don't really know what the value is until you measure it might seem obvious but a lot of projects finish off and don't take enough time to look back and see if they actually accomplish what they intended in particular if they accomplish the value that was the reason for for the project in the first place so we talked a little bit there about tangible and intangible value let's take a closer look at those types of value so tangible things you can see the list there you know they're physical things in in the real world but you know also things like monetary assets which is both you know potentially physical but you know it could be relatively intangible in terms of things like credit or other values like that you can also see at the bottom of the list of the tangible options here it lists market share think that's a very interesting one because market share definitely measurable not sure if it's tangible but you'll note in the definition to talk about some of these things are kind of both and i i think market share is a good example of the kind of value which could be described as being both tangible and intangible on the intangible side we'll see a lot of things here that you know you can't touch brand recognition reputation goodwill those things how the public perceives you how your customers think of you very important and can be worth an awful lot we can see massive brand investments by world class brands like a coke or apple or organizations like that that spend a tremendous amount of money and energy making sure that their intangible value is maximized and they get a a tremendous amount of of profit from that overall so keep in mind that this is the breadth of things that we consider value and when we're planning and assessing especially assessing the viability of a project and whether or not we should initiate it so why do we do a project and i don't mean why would you do a particular project but why are projects ever done so the technical term for this is the project initiation context one of those really great terms we're gonna keep seeing here it's very precise though and it mean something very important and that is for any given organization why would they initiate a product or commit to doing the work well typically there's sort of there's four categories external requirements stakeholder requirements strategic change and then create improve or fix something so though those external requirements that could be something like meeting regulatory legal or social requirements so especially in the financial industry in on the it side a lot we see different kinds of legislation or financial options that require audit or work financial controls in place to stop things like money laundering so that could be one of those options stakeholder requirement if if the board of directors or the c suite has decided on a strategic objective for the organization or if you have a major customer who's responsible for ten percent of your business and they've come to you saying that we a problem want you guys to solve it and your organization decides that you can solve it in a market driven way which means that you can take those customer requirements but build something that's gonna fit the marketplace in general so you can sell it to other people in that would be in a couple of examples of what stakeholder requirements look like in terms of strategic change there could be a a big shift so particularly things around say moving to the cloud you know their organizations still who have not done that and some maybe we'll never go and that's okay there's definitely good reasons to continue to to have c or on premise server resources but going to the cloud i think is a very good example of a strategic change that would require a a more than require it really justify benefit from project management and then lastly and this is kinda like the the odds and ends you know catch all category here here's like if the organization just wants to create improve or fix something if it's if it's big enough in the in the rewards are are significant enough for doing so then using the full project management framework or techniques will be worth it and that is the purpose of projects
Unit 2.1 - Topic 3 - Benefits of Project Management.webm: okay next we'll look at benefits of project management so there's a very long list of benefits here i'm not gonna read the ball and in fact we started this conversation in the last and the last unit when we were comparing project management in service management and talking about why you would wanna do this and what some of the benefits are you'll see a really clear theme here about you know predictability and increasing chances of success keeping costs down reducing risk all those kinds of things really the the entire enterprise of project management is to say we have a an important change that can deliver a lot of value and it's worth it to this organization to invest resources to maximize the chance that this will be successful because it's very important to our strategy it might even be critical to the success in the future of the organization as we go through the project management content of this course you'll see that it it's a it can be a lot so we need to make sure that we're not over investing in project management just for the sake of doing it we always wanna make sure that we're aligning our project management practices or tailoring our project management practices to the needs of that particular project and our organization i think that i what one of the things i i just wanna focus on is the last point here the benefit of of project management of being to manage change in a better manner i really like that one because to me strategically that's the role of project management is is about managing this kind of change and you remember that the last student was just talking about managing change overall we wrapped up with that topic on the culture of change and how important the human element of change is so i wanna make sure that we continue to think about that role and that relationship throughout the course so let's take a look at the risks of not using project management i'm gonna look at this one a little bit more closely you know missed deadlines cost overrun poor quality rework so you don't if you don't use project management practices you're increasing the chance that won't be done on time it won't be done well or that you'll have to redo it but i think one of the biggest risks and one of the most expensive things outcomes negative outcomes of not using project management would be that's that fifth point there uncontrolled expansion of the project i gonna i hope that you are familiar with a term scope creep if not you can go google it and look it up but you know it's a the death of of of countless software projects has and it projects have have been caused because of scope of creep one of the key things you're gonna see throughout the project management content of this course is how important defining what the project is what it isn't as well and then making sure that you have a clear agreement on that and that you're able to not only deliver on those things but the measurement of this success is delivering on those things we might think sometimes of stretch goals being a good thing and i'm not saying that they're not but those stretch goals need to be baked into a project at the beginning and need a very clear go no go or green light approval process from the project sponsor especially around resources to make sure that we're not doing more than as needed in fact doing more than is needed could be a one way to one indication that a project has actually not been successful so that's something important that i'd like you to think about then there's are some broader things something like loss of reputation for the organization a few years ago microsoft released us an ai bot that was within twenty four hours turned into a foul mouth swearing personality and microsoft took a hit for that you know on the one hand i actually pretty impressed that microsoft took that risk and it was an important step i think in their development as an organization but you know i here i am also still talking about it so wood project management have fixed that i don't know i i i'd have to know what their project plan looked like it particularly what the quality testing part of it was and what kind of simulation they did for having that ai bot be trained at scale by by basically just a public group of people but ultimately the when you don't use project management practices you're increasing the chance of the project not being successful
Unit 2.1 - Topic 4 - Project Lifecycles.webm: next up is project life cycles so there's an established project life cycle with with some key faith phases starting the project organizing preparing ke out the work ending the project those are very broad and we'll see quite a bit more specificity later on in the course we also see process groups or kinds of processes that'll occur and then a bunch of knowledge areas as well that those process groups draw upon and we'll definitely take a look at all of those but before we move into that i want to take a look at the four types of life cycles or project like cycles and that those are predictive iterative incremental and adaptive so these diagrams all come from website blog posting that is intended to describe exactly these life cycles from the the pm box sixth edition so i've included that link here and the link is also available on in our course and then the actual text come from the the the pin box guide so a predictive life cycle every part of it all the phases those are all determined in the early phases of the life cycle you start off by to defining all of these things and any change of scope is very carefully managed this is in part a reaction to or to der risk that problem of scope creep that i just talked about predictive life cycles can also be referred to as waterfall life cycle i think you'll see that similarity we talked about waterfall versus agile in the unit one lecture so this is an example of that predictive life cycle and you can see it moves sequentially and once it's sort of a one and done system once you're done one phase or one of the of the life cycle you move on to the next and you just simply don't go back so the next life cycle that we'll look at is the iterative life cycle and here the project scope is generally determined early but time and cost estimates keep getting modified as you iterate integrate through all of the steps or the phases of the project so what you would do is that you can see in the diagram here you go through all of those phases in this case build test plan requirements design you know all all around there i said that in the wrong order sorry plan required my requirements analysis design build and test sorry that's the correct way you'll see that there's a timeline here and you do that over and over i might refer to that as a lab wins repeat sort of process so these iterations develop the product or service or whatever the outcome that you're seeking through a series of repeated cycles and incrementally add to the functionality of the products so you might first do all if it's software it might do all the logins and then start building out the user account function and then start working on some of the core functionality of that product don't wanna a networking scenario you might drop in your your primary drop in your initial switch and then you'll might split that off and start setting up your different routers and things like that so that's the iterative life cycle let's next look at the incremental lifestyle life cycle so we can see here that this is deliver that the deliverable is produced there was series of iterations and it has successfully successive adds functionality within a predetermined time frame each of these increments goes through all of the steps and like we saw before what you'll see instead of the it iterative model where you full you complete the full cycle before you move on you see that there's overlap here this deliverable contains the necessary efficient capability to be complete only after the final iteration so that means increment one can't be shipped increment two can't be shipped if increment three is the final increment then that can be shipped so lastly let's take a look at the adaptive life cycle these are agile iterative or incremental they're kind of all blended together the detailed scope is defined and approved the start of an iteration and then you go through the cycle for that particular feature this has a strong emphasis on being able to deliver after each iteration or increment depending how you how you're structuring the work so you can see here we still have a lot of the same steps however the whole plan and requirements part of it has been separated and of is provided ahead of time before you start pulling things into the actual development work or the project work depending on the context very if you're familiar with software agile agile software development this will look very familiar to you adaptive cycles they're also referred to as agile or change driven cycles and once again we did see this cycle or this model when in the previous unit when we talked about waterfall versus agile models i also wanna be super clear i wanna remind you that there is a lot of waterfall or predictive philosophy and practices in project management in the p and p certification but as you can see i i mentioned in the previous unit that it isn't all like that and we can't simply say that project management is waterfall and this is a very good example that you know more recently they've done some really great work within in the body of knowledge to bring in and in fact at that the the the pm box to include these these newer kinds of methodologies so those are the key different life cycles there's one more that the talks about which really isn't actually its own sort of model or life cycle but it's just a hybrid and i'd love to if you can find a better picture for a hybrid i i'd really love to see it this is the best i could come up with i really like this one because it's a little bit messy and there's different kinds of ice creams even inside of the ice creams or different bits and the gives a nice sense of everything being mixed together so that's just a combination of these different kinds of life cycles and this is a very good way to pick and choose the right pieces for each organization so that is a really nice way for us to segue into the idea of tailoring so what is project management tailoring well you know not as i've mentioned before and i'll say several more times throughout the course it's not every process tool technique input or output identify in the pe box guide is required on every project what we need to do is make sure that when we are launching a project not only are we making sure that it's the right project for the right reason and that we can afford it and we'll have the right it's gonna drive the right change and create the right value but also that we're using the right project management techniques and systems and processes that means that project management tailoring needs to make sure that the competing constraints of scope schedule cost resources quality and risk are all being properly addressed for us you'll note that those things are gonna be different for every organization and those constraints are gonna be different for every project that's why tailoring is so important the importance of each of those constraints is different for every project and the project manager is going needs to be able to tailor the approach from managing these constraints based on the project environment organizational culture stakeholder needs and and other variables there's lots of them but yeah that's that's the importance of tailoring i wanna make sure that i focus on this last box here that tailoring is a collaboration between project managers project team sponsor and management it is not something that the project manager dictates to anyone it's a collaborative that's a collaboration and a negotiation but also on the other hand other organizations or team member shouldn't be telling the project manager how to run the project project managers what we're gonna assume have experience expertise capability skill and talent and we need to respect that and and be able to acknowledge that expertise within the team and that was project life cycles
Unit 2.1 - Topic 5 - Project Processes & Knowledge.webm: next we'll take a look at project processes and knowledge so project management processes is a very broad term it covers an awful lot of things at the highest level what we see here are inputs tools and techniques and then outputs this diagram is describing how those things can have different inputs different techniques and create different outputs and those things can all and interconnect and overlap there are three categories of phases when you're looking at these kinds of processes and those would be single use phases those that occur once or pre predetermined points in a project such as developing a project charter or closing a project second there are periodic phases these occur as needed such as acquire resources or conducting procurement and then lastly your continuous phases these occur throughout the project such as define activities or monitor control processes as well or five groups of processes that that are identified in the in the pm box initiating planning executing monitoring controlling and and closing there's quite a bit of information in the book about this i'll give you a very brief intro to each of those here and if you you you wanna look at the a more detailed description please go to that to the booking in that section one point one for that so when initiating process group these are processes form to define a new project or at least a new phase of an existing project really important part of this is getting the right authorization to start the project or phase so that is gonna involve working with a sponsor and getting authorization for resources and things like that next is the planning process group these are all processes that are required to establish the scope of the project or refine the objectives also to define the course of action required to achieve those objectives that was the reason for undertaking the entire project correct after planning we've executing this is the doing processes these processes are performed to complete the work which were which has been defined in the in the plan so that we can know that we've completed the project next are monitoring and controlling processes these are all the different kinds of processes that are needed to track review and regulate the progress and performance of the project to be clear this isn't monitoring or controlling the things that the project is doing this is on the meta level on monitoring controlling the project itself it will these will identify any areas which changes the plan sorry and identify as where changes to the plan are required and and initiate the corresponding changes and then lastly to book end nicely with the initiating process group is the closing group and this these are just the processes that you know formally complete close a project a phase or contract at an earlier diagram we saw how those different prod process groups connect with or or rely on the project management knowledge areas there are ten of these i'm not gonna go through them all i i will sort of quickly touch on each of them once again detailed explanation and more material is available in section one point one of the pm box guide on o'reilly online learning so project integration management one of the things i'm gonna just stop first one of the things i don't like about the way this is framed is that they all have project and management at the at the beginning of the end it kind of feels like we could just call them integration scope schedule cost but i also understand that they're trying to be very specific in identifying and creating common vocabulary for project management throughout all industries but also so that when we're talking about these things we're able to distinguish them from other kinds of scheduling that might happen so keep that in mind so the first knowledge area is project integration management so this is everything that needs to this is sorry all the knowledge in activities around identifying defining combining and coordinating the various processes and project management activities within all of the groups then we have project scope management this includes the process required to ensure the project includes all the work required and only the work required to complete the projects successfully that'll ties back to the discussion we had at a previous topic in this unit around making sure you don't end up when that scope creep place and while stretch goals are an important thing if they're pretty predefined or get that that authorization from the sponsor what you don't want to do is end up with a project where you have done more than than was actually decided project schedule management includes the process required to manage the timely and completion of the project cost management is everything we're on planning estimating budgeting financing funding controlling costs of the project can be completed within the approved budget quality management this is everything that's needed in terms of the quality policy established by the organization that'll include planning managing and controlling the project and product quality requirements to meet stakeholders expectations if you're not familiar with the word stakeholders gonna be used a lot throughout the course and that is a broad way of saying people who who have a stake or who have a voice in the outcome and direction of your work that could be internal people for sure but it could also be external people such as customers or partners industry analysts things like that resource management is about managing acquiring identifying and managing the resources for the successful completion that typically is gonna be not be money that's gonna be things like the right people or the right equipment the right fixtures things like that communications management is all about ensuring that we have a timely and appropriate planning collection creation distribution storing all that kind of stuff around the information of the of the project itself this is incredibly important and you know projects live or die by how well you're able to communicate i i wouldn't want to say that any of these things aren't important but i do know that in certainly in my experience communication is often a pain point and making sure that you get everyone in the organization aligned around making sure you're heading in the right direction is based on how effectively you're able to communicate so risk management is around all of the risk management planning and medication analysis and response on how to deal with the risks on the project that'll vary widely it could be something like a delay or a cost overrun but you know if you weren't making medical devices or or air air flight navigation you know those risks could involve lives and things like that so it's a very important dimension to to the pm knowledge areas procurement management is everything that's needed to purchase or acquire the product services or the results needed from outside the project team you'll notice that that they refer to that to outside the project team so that could potentially be inside the same organization depending how that organization is set up i know some organizations it is a is seen as an internally billing or an internally billing unit so any work that's done or a servers that's provided to another unit gets build so this would certainly fall within that and then lastly is stakeholder management this is extremely important this aligns quite carefully or sort of aligns quite a quite a bit with communications but i really appreciate and agree with the fact that they've done something a little bit different here by calling out how important the stakeholder management is so that's gonna include everything to it and if identify the people the groups the organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project you know manage their expectations and how they're the perceptions of how what the outcomes of the project will be and into develop appropriate management strategy to engage them to make sure that the right people are consulted in the right way that the right people are inputting or contributing to decisions and the ultimate execution of the project as well so there's a a number of different documents that are part of any project the project business case the benefits management plan the project charter and the project man management plan again we're not gonna go into deep detail here there's lots of this in that section one point one in the in the pin box guide quickly though or briefly the business case is the economic analysis of project feasibility and it determines the potential need and value of of a project it's really critical to deciding whether or not a project's is gonna happen whether it's gonna be initiated or not the project benefits management plan this is gonna identify the expected benefits of a project and who will benefit and by when the project charter to me is the most important thing but that's because my experience is either as a project manager or as a lead contributor on on projects and this is the document that's issued by the sponsor that formally authorizes the project and provides the authority resources for the project to to initiate the other thing project charters often do have a working agreement and an escalation protocols so that if things aren't going according to plan how do we deal with that situation and you know i've never been on a project where everything went according to plans of those understanding those things ahead of time are is extremely important and then lastly this is probably what you think of most if you don't have a lot of experience with project management plan but with project management in general is the project management plan it just describes how the project will executed monitored and control you've probably seen this kind of thing with lots of dates or assignments or a gan chart or things like that really important to see all the work that comes ahead of time before we even get to that project management plan so the last thing i'm gonna talk about for this topic is project success metrics and so how do we know if a project is successful well before we start it we need to make sure we've asked a couple of key questions like what does success look like for this project how are we gonna measure it and what could impact that which is another way of saying what are the risks but also you know what what are the opportunities you know metrics are measurable things so there could be financial metrics things like return on investment net present value other things like that there could be legal metrics did you meet regulatory or contractual obligations of course we could look at operational metrics do we have increased adoption do we decreased downtime things like that and lastly satisfaction metrics customer sponsor stakeholders the thing that's most important here is that is that point i'm gonna say again because it's it's so important metrics are measurable things so number one if if your sponsor the ceo or the vp senior vp of infrastructure is happy that's not a metric that's a story so what we need to do is we need to be able to have a measurable way so you know this would be something probably in the realm of qualitative research where we wanna have l scales and potentially some qualitative data as well but if we only do it after the project is done we have no baseline to compare it to so keep in mind that these kinds of metrics really need to have it before and after state before the project potentially during if if you're using an iterative or incremental a life cycle and then after and that's how you're really gonna be able to understand and have the evidence of that kind of success and that's it for project process and knowledge
Unit 2.1 - Topic 6 - Organizational Project Management.webm: next we have organizational project management so broadly this is going to talk about or this part of the pm p certification and then the pm box is about how how does an organization think about project management throughout the organization in particular how does one organize all the projects that are happening and the key way that that is used is to organize them as projects programs and portfolios and then outside of that to also understand the role that operations has keep in mind that you know projects all have a started at an end and so that is going to be true of programs programs are made of projects it's also gonna be true of portfolios because portfolios are made up of programs you could think of them as as a nested russian dolls or operations is an ongoing thing so it doesn't have that same that same requirement so let's take a little closer look at the elements of organizational project management we already have a really good idea where projects are so not gonna get you know two to into that but you know they enable the achievement of a of a gold or objective so what do we see with the program while a program manages many pro projects in particular programs are gonna look at the inter dependencies between projects this is where you're gonna find the duplication of effort or perhaps projects are working at across purpose so they're you know badly on line perhaps north log and need to sort that out so that you know the organization isn't trying to move in into directions at one time and that all those different pro projects are aligned with the right strategy now a portfolio and you know not all organizations are gonna have program managers and portfolio management it really depends on the size again these are additional costs so if you don't have a high risk of your projects not being aligned or there if there's if you don't have multiple projects at one time and these probably aren't necessary but in a larger organization you'll almost certainly have a a pm a program management office or a project management office or potentially a portfolio management office portfolios manages many programs and aligns them with the strategic vision and prior prioritization work across the entire organization often the portfolio team or portfolio manager will also be heavily involved in managing resources since that's the highest level of of allocation in the organization i'm really excited to finally talk about operations projects are great but you know they they are that they are unique and temporary there's an awful lot of things that happens in an organizations that are ops that's just the ongoing production of goods and services making sure that you know we're not we're using the right amount of resources to meet customer needs you're gonna see later on that that sounds an awful lot like service management in that ongoing way that just keeps ticking along and but there's a lot of intersection points up between project management and operations or service management if you like that's certainly something we'll work we'll we will return to for sure in this course so let's talk a little bit about project influences so you know where does a project live and i mean that you know not enough in a house on a the street kind way but you know i've talked about how unique each project is but also how unique each organization is we've talked about how important tailoring is but you know more broadly than that the context for a project is very important so like what are the kinds of organizational systems that could influence or overall what are all of the influence is that are going to affect a project because these are the things that a project manager needs to keep in mind at that organizational systems level we're gonna see things like management elements how is your company structured is there a lot of vps are you a fully owned subsidiary that does its own thing are you part of the franchise what are the governance frameworks who has to have approvals for spending or hiring procurement things like that and then organizational organizational structures how was your organizational organize what are the departments is that aligned with the goals of the project or are you gonna have to work harder and lift more because of how your organization and the departments and units are structured beyond that that large idea of organizational systems are two very important pieces that get a lot of time in the pe box and that is you so now we're in section one point two of of the guide and those two things are ee and op ups that's a a pretty common acronym you're gonna see them a lot and they're called enterprise environmental factors in organizational process assets and those are very specific things different from those overall in organizational systems so just before we move on to look at ee and op you know i i was a senior product manager at p w in toronto as part of their ventures lab which is an internal software accelerator and they had some very interesting and for me new organizational systems particularly around management and governance that i wasn't familiar with and took a lot of learning to be able to be to took a lot of learning to be successful in in in getting things out the door there so the two thing i'll talk about is that you p is a partner system which means you know six hundred partners in within the canadian firm and partner are literally owners of the company and so the the way that that works is very different and sometimes i earlier just talked a little bit about the portfolio organization and the program organization making sure that we have good coordination that we're not working across purpose well sometimes that happens at p or or any organization that structure is a partnership because partners have a tremendous amount of independence they see that as an advantage and it's certainly you know they're a very successful company there's obviously some some truth to that the other thing is that financial independence making sure that a project that i work on i don't have a financial interest in is very important so you p audits you know lots of big banks if that means that i can't have stock in those banks if if i'm in an audit role there they also have a tremendous amount of compliance requirements of that because they're in a highly regulated industry so i just wanted to give a little bit of my personal experience on what those organizational systems would look like and so now that we've done that let's take a look at ee and op so in enterprise environmental factors these are the conditions that are not under the control of the project team and they're gonna influence and probably constrain the the project these can be internal or external you know in turn of the in terms of the internal side of things there's lots of different i won't read that whole list there but you know things about where people live what it systems you have who's available now do we have someone internally who even knows us how to do that those are all the kinds of things that come under enterprise environmental factors when we look at the extra of the internal ones when we look at the external ones there's lots of things here and you know we're doing this course online right now for an external enterprise environmental factor and that's covid nineteen you know so from marketplace conditions to social and cultural influences we see down at the end of that list environmental elements which include things like being able to go outside and and mean in the classroom and things like that so that is the kind of thing or that that is those are the things that comprise enterprise environmental fact years so that leaves us with organizational process assets and these are all the things that your organization has that can that are required and will either elevate or hinder your your project these are all the plans and processes policies procedures and knowledge bases all of those kinds of things that are used by your organization so in terms of those processes policies and procedures these could be things like templates or supplies list procurement procedures all sorts of things this is a a compressed list from what's in the in the pin pinpoint guide so if you wanna learn more about this that's the place to go outside of the processes policies and procedures is the organizational knowledge basis so as it professionals you're probably very familiar with the configuration management database but also things like a financial data repository an issue in defect database is also probably near and dear to people in an it or software setting but even things like previous project files and a lessons learned file are also included in the idea of those organizational process assets and that wraps up organizational project management
Unit 2.1 - Topic 7 - The Triple Constraint.webm: now we'll take a look at the triple constraint so the triple constraint is a very important idea you'll also notice that it isn't explicitly referenced in the the pm box guide but i wanna make sure that you know about it and i i don't think an introduction to project management would be fully complete without talking about the triple constraint you may heard of this before you know there's a an old joke and software that you know you can get the work done well faster or cheap pick two and that's so there's some truths to that but the triple constraint is looking at the constraints of time cost and scope and that typically you can't put constraints in all three of those things and have a successful project the idea of the triple constraint is that you could you need to have at least one degree of freedom need have at least one of these things needs to be flexible for a project to be successful so that means either you can say how much is gonna cost and what it's gonna do but yeah you need to be open to when it's gonna be done or you could say this is what it has to do and it has to be complete on this time but you can spend as much as you need those are the kinds of choices that the triple constraint suggests or or presents so just to be put make sure we're being clear costs or things like resources so that's money people things like that scope out of the requirements what needs to be accomplished to be done and then times pretty clear schedule when does the project need to be completed so this particular image i took from an article from project manager dot com from their blog and i have a snippet of that blog article here and i've included this this link in the course content for unit too you'll see here that it talks about how it can be easily are you that the tip triple can might be the single most important concept in the history of project management the genius who invented this model is on par with the first person who came up with the wheel okay clearly that's an exaggeration but you know this was written in in twenty eighteen and i i i remember learning about the book constraint to twenty years ago and it was old when i learned about it so it's a it's a piece of very well worn advice that you know this entire company basically bases their pitch on the tools on being able to be reconcile the the the triple constraint that being said i want you to know that not everyone agrees with that here's an article a conference paper published on pm dot org called the triple constraint is a is a triple failure and what this is all about is saying that you know the not that the constraint model is wrong the things that we've chosen for them aren't correct and they they go through very well ways argument about that my sense is that after reading the article client i'm not fully convinced that we should step away from it we're not using it i i think they're uncovering better level of precision in naming those three things and i think people more think about the way that they talk about it when they use those three words scope time and cost but i really appreciate that people are being rigorous and and pressure testing this idea i'd be really interested in hearing your response to what you think about this article that critiques the triple constraint so that's it for the triple constraint you know that's also it for the topics in unit two point one so of course if you have questions i really wanna hear them there's the questions discussion thread then i linked to that in the unit to content as well so please ask whatever questions you like and i look forward to seeing how you guys can support each other by answering them but also how i can support your learning and success in this course as well thanks so much
Unit 2.2 - Ethics & Professional Conduct.webm: hi there welcome back this is professor y with understanding product management unit two point two ethics and professional conduct so in this unit we're gonna be looking at the pm code of ethics understanding what it is we'll also be taking a look at the four key values that are identified in that code of ethics there are also mandatory and aspirational standards for those so we'll make sure that we cover what that means and each of those standards this unit is primarily based on the code of ethics document so please be sure that you review it on your own in addition as part of your learning in this unit it is very well written and typically i don't wanna be reading slides in a lecture but in this case the exact of the language is quite important so i'll review specific language throughout this lecture the language of the code of conduct please keep in mind that this unit is in scope for assignment one the tale of two projects case study analysis as part of your analysis please be sure to include your thinking on any ethical or conduct dimensions of the case study in the pm box guide in section one point one there's a short segment on ethics and professional conduct please be sure you review that the code of ethics itself is available as a pdf in unit two content as is the link to the code of ethics page itself on the pm website i wanna be very clear that as as we're talking with ethics in professional conduct that this is not some kind of abstract idea that doesn't really affect us this is incredibly important and i would really hope that you see that and agree with that our values are a very important anchor or center of gravity for all of our work and it's very important that we choose every day to live our values what i mean by that is that it's very important that we don't just talk about them but we actually do them and that can be a very hard thing but what's really important is that your values matter not just when it's easy but actually most especially when it's hard when your values cost you something or you know our work for you to live that's when they matter if you don't if you only live your values or or rather if you don't live your values if you only commit your values when it's easy is pretty much indistinguishable for what having values at all values matter only as much as we choose to live them and that's a decision we have to make every day in every moment i also wanna be very clear that my expectation is that we all live these values and follow this cod ethics in this class so first up we'll be looking at what is the pm code of ethics well before we get directly into that i wanna make sure that we have a common vocabulary around and shared understanding around what ethics are so ethics are a field of philosophy but they're also a part of everyday life that involves the idea of what is right and wrong behavior you know we wanna be able to define and have a shared understanding in an agreement with what is good and evil right and wrong what is virtue and vice justice and crime more specifically the pm bmi code of ethics is a kind of business ethics business ethics are very simply the application of ethics and business but more specifically it's the practices of any individual or group within organization and how it could potentially negatively or positively affect the business core values but also the outcome of that business business ethics applies to all aspects of business conduct is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations so given that we have identified what ethics are i wanted to talk a little bit more about why why does this matter so part of what i did for that was i did a search for wire business ethics important or wire ethics important and this is one of the presentations that i found this is pretty standard maybe slightly better actually and i think there's some very good points here protects you from legal action helps the organization be consistent produces good business you know make sure that you're not seen un unfavorable by the public built goodwill in your community these are all really positive things but i also think that there are some things that are missing here i like you to just take a moment to think about what they might be so for me there are four key things and the most important is that it's just simply the right thing to do to be ethical is important because that's how society operates we have a social contract an agreement between all people in society that we will work together and we will act in an ethical way so it's the right thing to do and we have a duty to do the right thing especially as professionals especially as leaders we have a duty to do the right thing beyond just the innate importance of doing the right thing i think it's also very easy to see the consequence of not doing the right thing we're acting in an unethical way being ethical ensures we're acting with integrity and that we're trustworthy and if you're not able to do those then you're not the people and organizations that don't have integrity that don't that aren't trusted but don't act in a honest way they're not gonna be successful at least not in the long term okay so now let's take a look at that pm code of ethics and professional conduct as i mentioned it's in the unit two course content can also be found online and the link for that is in the course content the in the course content as well it's eight pages it's quite short and very well written i look forward to your feedback on it i've seen lots of these kinds of things and this is definitely one of the best that i i've seen in my opinion so the code of ethics begins with a vision and purpose which i think is exactly the right thing to do and it says as practitioners of project management we are committed to doing what is right and honorable so this aligns us exactly with the ethics conversation that we just had furthermore we set high standards for ourselves we aspire to meet these standards in all aspects of our lives at work at home and inn service to our profession so it's very important that this isn't something you switch on when you go to work and switch off when you're done you know i really appreciate and support the fact that this code of ethics acknowledges that we're whole people we aren't somebody different at work when we are at home and and acknowledges that in their vision and purpose this code describes the expectations that we have of ourselves and our fellow practitioners in the global project management community so there's two really important things happening there talks about how this applies to us but as an expectation a personal professional expectation but also the expectation we have for the other practitioners that we work with and it's all part of a global project management community i think that's very important lastly the code articulate the ideals to which we aspire as well as the behaviors that are mandatory and our professional volunteer roles so this is really important there are things that are we must do and there are things that we are expected to do those things that we must do are mandatory the things that we're expected to do are aspirational and we'll see that as we go through each of the key values of the code of ethics you'll also know that they start with app aspirational standards and then follow with mandatory i just wanna make sure that you're clear that i intentionally switched this order in the lecture to emphasize the importance of the mandatory standards so next we have the application of the code right this is a code apply to everyone in the entire world nope it's gonna apply to all pm members that means that you know your paid member of the organization but it also applies to individuals who are not members of pm but also our hold a pm certification alright you could certainly be certified and then choose to not be a member it also applies to anyone who has started or commenced a pm certification process i really love that you don't have to actually get the certification for these rules to apply to you i'll just reiterate one more time that this is not a certification course so that's we're clear on that and then lastly it also applies to anyone who serves the pm mind of volunteer capacity things those are really great rules and that makes a lot of sense and i'll also remind you that the expectation in this course the the standard in this course is that we will all follow this code of ethics in our work and interactions in this and that is what is the pm code of ethics
Unit 2.2 - The PMI Values.webm: and now we'll start the pm values so the values are were developed by collaborating and asking the membership in the global community how they made decisions and and what guided their actions and four things came out of that responsibility respect fairness and honesty and we'll go into each of those one at a time as part of this topic before we do that let's take a look at the mandatory and aspirational standards mandatory standards for the pm code of ethics are things that we are required to do with it also relatively easy to measure the mandatory standards establish firm requirements and in some cases limit or prohibit practitioner behavior so not only as it say what we can do it it'll also say things that we're not allowed to do practitioners who do not conduct themselves in accordance with these standards will be subject disciplinary procedures before the pm ethics review committee so i think what one of the really powerful and useful things about this quote ethics is that there is an enforcement protocol of course because we or perhaps you are a pm and my member i don't know i am not a p my member so at this point we would not be subject to those disciplinary procedures i will say that students who don't conduct themselves in accordance with these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures within this course so then we have the aspirational standards and these are things that we're expected to do and also there's more difficult to measure so these standard describe the conduct that we strive to uphold as practitioners although adherence to the the standards is not easily measured conducting ourselves in accordance with them is an expectation that we have over ourselves as professionals if it's not optional alright so with that let's take a look at that first value responsibility so the code of ethics defines this as we're responsibilities our duty to take ownership for the decisions we make or fail to make the actions that we take or fail to take and the consequences that result what's really important here is that they're framing responsibly not only as doing something which is that we need to take accountability for or rather that we need to own not own the things that we do but also the things that we fail to do so for responsibility there are mandatory standards around regulations and legal requirements and also ethical planes so for regulations and legal requirements the mandatory standards for responsibility are that we inform ourselves and uphold the policy rules regulations and laws that govern our work profession and volunteer activities also that we report unethical or a legal conduct to appropriate management and if necessary to those affected by the conduct you know these these provisions have several implications specifically that we don't engage in a legal behavior that you know includes what isn't limited to things like theft fraud corruption and belle bribery but also that we don't take or reviews the property of others including intellectual property and that we don't sla or libel anyone in terms of ethics complaints the mandatory standards are that we bring violations of this code to the attention of the appropriate body for resolution we only file ethics complaints that are by facts and that we pursue disciplinary action against an individual who retaliate against a person raising ethics concerns so some very important things here we've already talked about the enforcement protocol and the kinda of consequences it's also important that part of the standards itself part of the code ethics itself is not only to follow it but that if you see a violation including if you violate it that you need to report it and that it's not okay to re retaliate against people who are doing what is required if you see something you need to is something that's unethical you need to report it it's not fair that you'd face negative consequences for doing so given that that's a requirement it's also very important that we cooperate with any any questions or investigations into ethics violations or the collection of that kind of material and that we don't accuse others of ethic misconduct we don't have all the facts so that is those are the mandatory standards that's let's take a look at the responsibility aspirational standards so there's six of these and they are that we make decisions and take actions based on the best interest of society public safety and the environment the next is that we accept only those assignments that are consistent with their background experience skills and qualifications so i definitely wanna be clear that as students you're here to learn so that might sound troubling or confusing and i certainly don't expect you to only do the work that you already know because you're here to learn alright the next one is that we fulfill the commitments that we under take we do what we say we will do next is when we make errors or our emissions we take ownership to make corrections prompt when we discover errors or emissions caused by others we communicate them to the appropriate body as soon as they're discovered we accept accountability for any issues resulting from errors or our emissions and any result consequences you know sometimes doesn't feel very important sometimes you know you could just let that go by or or turn up blind item or something but this is an important habit it's an important value and as you progress in your career and have more responsibility this becomes more and more important and as we've mentioned before there are definitely industries and projects where you know harm could come to people due to these kinds of errors so it's very important that we follow this just like all of the standards next that we protect a proprietary or confident and confidential information that has been entrusted to us and then lastly that we have hold this call this code and hold each other accountable to it the next value is respect the code of ethics defines this as our duty to show a high regard for ourselves others and the resources entrusted to us resources and entrusted to us may include people money reputation the safety of others and natural or environmental resources an environment of respect and genders trust confidence in performance excellence by fostering mutual cooperation an environment where diverse perspectives and views are encouraged and valued i really like this one this resonates with me very strongly so the mandatory standards for respect are that we negotiate in good faith that we do not exercise the power of our expertise or position to influence the decisions or actions of others in an order to personally benefit at their expense that we do not act in an abusive manner towards others and that we respect the property rights of others as well the aspirational standards for respect are that we inform ourselves about the norms and customs of others and avoid and engaging in behaviors that they might considered are disrespectful that we listen to others points of view and that we seek to understand them that we approach directly those persons with whom we have a conflict or this agreement and that we conduct ourselves in a professional manner even when it's not reciprocate so you know that last one's really important that we're gonna operate and conductors all in a professional way even if other people aren't the other thing that i wanna comment here is that the the aspirational standards of respect and you know imply that we avoid in you know gossip pain or making negative remarks to undermine someone else's reputation and that we have a duty under this cod confront others who engage in those kinds of behaviors let's take a look at fairness fairness is defined in the code of ethics as our duty to make decisions in act partially and objectively our conduct must be free from competing self interest prejudice and favor so there's two key categories for the mandatory standards of fairness conflict of interest and favor and discrimination so for conflict interest we proactively and fully disclose any real or potential conflicts of interest to the appropriate stakeholders when we realize that we have a real or potential consultative interest we refrain from engaging in the decision making process or otherwise attempting to influence the outcome unless or until we've made a full disclosure to the affected stakeholders we have an approved mitigation plan and we have obtained the consent of stakeholders to proceed a lot going in that one it's quite complicated if you break it down i think it makes a lot of sense simply put if we have a competition of interest between ourselves and the project and we need to make sure that we are clear and transparent about that notify people and make sure that we have an an approved mitigation plan in terms of favor and discrimination the mandatory standards are we do not hire or fire reward or punish or reward or night contracts based on personal considerations in but not limited to favor ne or bribery furthermore we do not discriminate against others based on but not limited to gender race age religion disability nationality or sexual orientation and lastly we apply the rules of the organization without favor or prejudice so just to be super clear a conflict interest is when we have when when we're when we're in a position to influence an outcome and there's some kind of competition between my personal interest and the interest of anyone else involved so for example when we're acting as an employee we have a duty of loyalty to our employer when we're acting frank for example as a volunteer with the pm we have a duty of loyalty to the pm we must recognize these diver interests and refrain from influencing decisions well when we have a cost of interest okay let's take a look at the aspirational standards for fairness next so there's four these we demonstrate transparency and our decision making we constantly re examine our impartial and objectivity taking corrective action as appropriate we provide equal access information to those who authorized that the information and then lastly we make opportunities opportunities equally available to qualified candidates research with practitioners has shown that this subject conflict of interest is one of the most challenging faced by our profession it's one of the biggest problems that practitioners that partitions report is not recognizing we have conflicted loyal and recognizing when we're inadvertently placing ourselves or others in a conflict of interest so we have to be really proactive in how we seek out and check ourselves to make sure that we're not falling on the wrong side of this standard alright so the last of value is honesty honesty to defined in the code of ethics as our duty to understand the truth and act in a truthful manner both in our communications and in our conduct so them there are two mandatory standards the first is that we do not engage in or condone behavior that is designed to deceive others including but not limited to making misleading or false statements stating half truths providing information out of context or withholding information that if known would render our statements as misleading or incomplete that's a very well written and very tight definition furthermore we will not engage in dishonest behavior with the intention of personal gain or at the expense of another this this really states how important is that we need to be truth truthful half truths and non disclosures intended in this lead are as unprofessional as actually stating a lie so we're we only develop credibility by complete and accurate information so the this slide is wrong here this should be should be honesty my apologies so the aspirational standards honesty that we earnest seek to understand the truth we truthful in our communications and in our conduct we provide accurate information in a timely manner we make commitments and promises implied or explicit in good faith and lastly we strive to create an environment which others feel safe to tell the truth that last one is so important now safety to tell the truth is how you will get more projects to be successful than not saying that there's a problem can can feel very dangerous and unsafe so as a project manager you have a a a significant responsibility and opportunity to create that kind of environment we need to make sure that we're just making your decisions based on or providing to others information that's accurate reliable and timely right and that absolutely includes having the courage to share bad news even when will be poorly received in fact one of the thing that distinguishes great project managers from from the pack is the ability to communicate that bad news and deal with that poor reception and get the project back on track when outcomes are negative we avoid bearing information or shifting blamed to others where their positive it's just as important that we don't take credit for the achievements of others you know we need to be make sure that we're honest and responsible in how we work so lastly i'm just gonna touch one once again on how important it is that we live our values through this course through our work that having an ethical center to all of our work is incredibly important so with that i'll remind you that you can always ask questions i know that these lectures with me talking and not having a conversation with you face to face isn't is at least for me it's challenging i'm really used to having more of a back and forth i really look forward to your questions and also hope that you guys are open to and excited about supporting each other in those discussions as well that's it for the pm values

are all really positive things but i also think that there are some things that are missing here i like you to just take a moment to think about what they might be so for me there are four key things and the most important is that it's just simply the right thing to do to be ethical is important because that's how society operates we have a social contract an agreement between all people in society that we will work together and we will act in an ethical way so it's the right thing to do and we have a duty to do the right thing especially as professionals especially as leaders we have a duty to do the right thing beyond just the innate importance of doing the right thing i think it's also very easy to see the consequence of not doing the right thing we're acting in an unethical way being ethical ensures we're acting with integrity and that we're trustworthy and if you're not able to do those then you're not the people and organizations that don't have integrity that don't that aren't trusted that don't act in a honest way they're not gonna be successful at least not in the long term okay so now let's take a look at that pm code of ethics and professional conduct as i mentioned it's in the unit two course content can also be found online and the link for that is in the course content the in the course content as well it's eight pages it's quite short and very well written i look forward to your feedback on it i've seen lots of these kinds of things and this is definitely one of the best that i i've seen in my opinion so the code of ethics begins with a vision and purpose which i think is exactly the right thing to do and it says as practitioners of project management we are committed to doing what is right and honorable so this aligns us exactly with the ethics conversation that we just had furthermore we set high standards for ourselves we aspire to meet these standards in all aspects of our lives at work at home and inn service to our profession so it's very important that this isn't something you switch on when you go to work and switch off when you're done you know i really appreciate and support the fact that this code of ethics acknowledges that we're whole people we aren't somebody different at work when we are at home and and acknowledges that in their vision and purpose this code describes the expectations that we have of ourselves and our fellow practitioners in the global project management community so there's two really important things happening there talks about how this applies to us but as an expectation a personal professional expectation but also the expectation we have for the other practitioners that we work with and it's all part of a global project management community i think that's very important lastly the code articulate the ideals to which we aspire as well as the behaviors that are mandatory and our professional volunteer roles so this is really important there are things that are we must do and there are things that we are expected to do those things that we must do are mandatory the things that we're expected to do are aspirational and we'll see that as we go through each of the key values of the code of ethics you'll also know that they start with app aspirational standards and then follow with mandatory i just wanna make sure that you're clear that i intentionally switched this order in the lecture to emphasize the importance of the mandatory standards so next we have the application of the code right this is a code apply to everyone in the entire world nope it's gonna apply to all pm members that means that you know your paid member of the organization but it also applies to individuals who are not members of pm but also our hold a pm certification alright you could certainly be certified and then choose to not be a member it also applies to anyone who has started or commenced a pm certification process i really love that you don't have to actually get the certification for these rules to apply to you i'll just reiterate one more time that this is not a certification course so that's we're clear on that and then lastly it also applies to anyone who serves the pm mind of volunteer capacity things those are really great rules and that makes a lot of sense and i'll also remind you that the expectation in this course the the standard in this course is that we will all follow this code of ethics in our work and interactions in this first and that is what is the pm code of ethics
Unit 2.2 - Topic 2 - The PMI Values.webm: and now we'll start the pm values so the values are were developed by collaborating and asking the membership in the global community how they made decisions and and what guided their actions and four things came out of that responsibility respect fairness and honesty and we'll go into each of those one at a time as part of this topic before we do that let's take a look at the mandatory and aspirational standards mandatory standards for the pm code of ethics are things that we are required to do with it also relatively easy to measure the mandatory standards establish firm requirements and in some cases limit or prohibit practitioner behavior so not only as it say what we can do it it'll also say things that we're not allowed to do practitioners who do not conduct themselves in accordance with these standards will be subject disciplinary procedures before the pm ethics review committee so i think what one of the really powerful and useful things about this quote ethics is that there is an enforcement protocol of course because we or perhaps you are a pm and my member i don't know i am not a p my member so at this point we would not be subject to those disciplinary procedures i will say that students who don't conduct themselves in accordance with these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures within this course so then we have the aspirational standards and these are things that we're expected to do and also there's more difficult to measure so these standard describe the conduct that we strive to uphold as practitioners although adherence to the the standards is not easily measured conducting ourselves in accordance with them is an expectation that we have over ourselves as professionals if it's not optional alright so with that let's take a look at that first value responsibility so the code of ethics defines this as we're responsibilities our duty to take ownership for the decisions we make or fail to make the actions that we take or fail to take and the consequences that result what's really important here is that they're framing responsibly not only as doing something which is that we need to take accountability for or rather that we need to own not own the things that we do but also the things that we fail to do so for responsibility there are mandatory standards around regulations and legal requirements and also ethical planes so for regulations and legal requirements the mandatory standards for responsibility are that we inform ourselves and uphold the policy rules regulations and laws that govern our work profession and volunteer activities also that we report unethical or a legal conduct to appropriate management and if necessary to those affected by the conduct you know these these provisions have several implications specifically that we don't engage in a legal behavior that you know includes what isn't limited to things like theft fraud corruption and belle bribery but also that we don't take or reviews the property of others including intellectual property and that we don't sla or libel anyone in terms of ethics complaints the mandatory standards are that we bring violations of this code to the attention of the appropriate body for resolution we only file ethics complaints that are by facts and that we pursue disciplinary action against an individual who retaliate against a person raising ethics concerns so some very important things here we've already talked about the enforcement protocol and the kinda of consequences it's also important that part of the standards itself part of the code ethics itself is not only to follow it but that if you see a violation including if you violate it that you need to report it and that it's not okay to re retaliate against people who are doing what is required if you see something you need to is something that's unethical you need to report it it's not fair that you'd face negative consequences for doing so given that that's a requirement it's also very important that we cooperate with any any questions or investigations into ethics violations or the collection of that kind of material and that we don't accuse others of ethic misconduct we don't have all the facts so that is those are the mandatory standards that's let's take a look at the responsibility aspirational standards so there's six of these and they are that we make decisions and take actions based on the best interest of society public safety and the environment the next is that we accept only those assignments that are consistent with their background experience skills and qualifications so i definitely wanna be clear that as students you're here to learn so that might sound troubling or confusing and i certainly don't expect you to only do the work that you already know because you're here to learn alright the next one is that we fulfill the commitments that we entered take we do what we say we will do next is when we make errors or our emissions we take ownership to make corrections prompt when we discover errors or emissions caused by others we communicate them to the appropriate body as soon as they're discovered we accept accountability for any issues resulting from errors or our emissions and any result consequences you know sometimes doesn't feel very important sometimes you know you could just let that go by or or turn up blind item or something but this is an important habit it's an important value and as you progress in your career and have more responsibility this becomes more and more important and as we've mentioned before there are definitely industries and projects where you know harm could come to people due to these kinds of errors so it's very important that we follow this just like all of the standards next that we protect a proprietary or confident and confidential information that has been entrusted to us and then lastly that we have hold this call this code and hold each other accountable to it the next value is respect the code of ethics defines this as our duty to show a high regard for ourselves others and the resources entrusted to us resources and entrusted to us may include people money reputation the safety of others and natural or environmental resources an environment of respect and genders trust confidence in performance excellence by fostering mutual cooperation an environment where diverse perspectives and views are encouraged and valued i really like this one this resonates with me very strongly so the mandatory standards for respect are that we negotiate in good faith that we do not exercise the power of our expertise or position to influence the decisions or actions of others in an order to personally benefit at their expense that we do not act in an abusive manner towards others and that we respect the property rights of others as well the aspirational standards for respect are that we inform ourselves about the norms and customs of others and avoid and engaging in behaviors that they might considered are disrespectful that we listen to others points of view and that we seek to understand them that we approach directly those persons with whom we have a conflict or this agreement and that we conduct ourselves in a professional manner even when it's not reciprocate so you know that last one's really important that we're gonna operate and conductors all in a professional way even if other people aren't the other thing that i wanna comment here is that the the aspirational standards of respect and you know imply that we avoid in you know gossip pain or making negative remarks to undermine someone else's reputation and that we have a duty under this cod confront others who engage in those kinds of behaviors let's take a look at fairness fairness is defined in the code of ethics as our duty to make decisions in act partially and objectively our conduct must be free from competing self interest prejudice and favor so there's two key categories for the mandatory standards of fairness conflict of interest and favor and discrimination so for conflict interest we proactively and fully disclose any real or potential conflicts of interest to the appropriate stakeholders when we realize that we have a real or potential consultative interest we refrain from engaging in the decision making process or otherwise attempting to influence the outcome unless or until we've made a full disclosure to the affected stakeholders we have an approved mitigation plan and we have obtained the consent of stakeholders to proceed a lot going in that one it's quite complicated if you break it down i think it makes a lot of sense simply put if we have a competition of interest between ourselves and the project and we need to make sure that we are clear and transparent about that notify people and make sure that we have an an approved mitigation plan in terms of favor and discrimination the mandatory standards are we do not hire or fire reward or punish or reward or night contracts based on personal considerations in but not limited to favor ne or bribery furthermore we do not discriminate against others based on but not limited to gender race age religion disability nationality or sexual orientation and lastly we apply the rules of the organization without favor or prejudice so just to be super clear a conflict interest is when we have when when we're when we're in a position to influence an outcome and there's some kind of competition between my personal interest and the interest of anyone else involved so for example when we're acting as an employee we have a duty of loyalty to our employer when we're acting frank for example as a volunteer with the pm we have a duty of loyalty to the pm we must recognize these diver interests and refrain from influencing decisions well when we have a cost of interest okay let's take a look at the aspirational standards for fairness next so there's four these we demonstrate transparency in our decision making we constantly re examine our impartial and objectivity taking corrective action as appropriate we provide equal access information to those who authorized that the information and then lastly we make opportunities opportunities equally available to qualified candidates research with practitioners has shown that this subject conflict of interest is one of the most challenging faced by our profession it's one of the biggest problems that practitioners that partitions report is not recognizing we have conflicted loyal and recognizing when we're inadvertently placing ourselves or others in a conflict of interest so we have to be really proactive in how we seek out and check ourselves to make sure that we're not falling on the wrong side of this standard alright so the last of value is honesty honesty to defined in the code of ethics as our duty to understand the truth and act in a truthful manner both in our communications and in our conduct so them there are two mandatory standards the first is that we do not engage in or condone behavior that is designed to deceive others including but not limited to making misleading or false statements stating half truths providing information out of context or withholding information that if known would render our statements as misleading or incomplete that's a very well written and very tight definition furthermore we will not engage in dishonest behavior with the intention of personal gain or at the expense of another this this really states how important is that we need to be truth truthful half truths and non disclosures intended in this lead are as unprofessional as actually stating a lie so we're we only develop credibility by complete and accurate information so the this slide is wrong here this should be should be honesty my apologies so the aspirational standards honesty that we earnest seek to understand the truth we truthful in our communications and in our conduct we provide accurate information in a timely manner we make commitments and promises implied or explicit in good faith and lastly we strive to create an environment which others feel safe to tell the truth that last one is so important now safety to tell the truth is how you will get more projects to be successful than not saying that there's a problem can can feel very dangerous and unsafe so as a project manager you have a a a significant responsibility and opportunity to create that kind of environment we need to make sure that we're just making your decisions based on or providing to others information that's accurate reliable and timely right and that absolutely includes having the courage to share bad news even when will be poorly received in fact one of the thing that distinguishes great project managers from from the pack is the ability to communicate that bad news and deal with that poor reception and get the project back on track when outcomes are negative we avoid bearing information or shifting blamed to others where their positive it's just as important that we don't take credit for the achievements of others you know we need to be make sure that we're honest and responsible in how we work so lastly i'm just gonna touch one once again on how important it is that we live our values through this course through our work that having an ethical center to all of our work is incredibly important so with that i'll remind you that you can always ask questions i know that these lectures with me talking and not having a conversation with you face to face isn't is at least for me it's challenging i'm really used to having more of a back and forth i really look forward to your questions and also hope that you guys are open to and excited about supporting each other in those discussions as well that's it for the pm values
Unit 2.3 - Topic 1 - Project Management Roles.webm: hello and welcome to unit two point three project management roles this is professor sean y so in this section we'll be looking at the different roles within product project management sorry the resources for this unit is part one point three the role of the product manager in the pm box guide a few other links that i'll refer to throughout the lectures i'll make sure all of these links are also included in the two point three folder in content in our online course so up first project management rules so section one point three in the pm box covers a lot of material i do think that they could do a better job in this chapter of defining the key project management roles and so i have some material here from a business harvard harvard business review article that i've linked to so most of the content in this section comes from that article five critical roles in project management so what are those roles well sponsor project manager team leader team member stakeholder and project steering committee you'll notice that the article talked about five roles and we have six here that's because they they didn't explicitly talk about stakeholders so i made sure we we included that because i think it's a very important role to understand so first of all who or what is the sponsor sponsor is the champion of the project at the highest level in the company so sometimes there's a sponsor sometimes it's all so an executive sponsor but really they're the the single person who is an advocate for the project they also need to have quite a bit of influence so they use the word clout here to communicate effectively with senior management especially the ceo and any other key stakeholders and provide the necessary resources in somebody who ultimately says that the project was at success or or not a success and make those kinds of decisions throughout the process i think we're quite familiar with the project manager role at this time but you know you know the project managers role the you know understand what the problem is to be solved and how to tackle it you know lots of responsibility around determining the projects objectives and scope sorry objectives and scope but then also the day to day planning and scheduling and monitoring and making sure we have the right resources at the right time where those are internal resources or vendor resources and then at the end make sure that we've evaluated the project make sure that we understand how or why it was successful or failure and provide lessons learned for the organization for future projects lots of different activities for project managers i i won't go through all of these i think we've seen these kinds of things before already and i think a relatively straightforward i did choose a process diagram here i wanna be clear this isn't exactly a step by step process but the different activities that are presented in the pm box on this do follow roughly the right kind of sequence for initiating a project through close so i thought i'd sort of put it in that framing but these things could be iterative as we know depending on the project style but also they could happen a different order this there's no single way that these things have to be be no single sequence things have to occur in and they don't all have to occur either so team leader very very important you know typically in a larger project the team leader will be a different person they say that this could include a team leader who reports directly the project manager i'd say an it and software companies in my experience that is rarely the case pro project managers typically don't have an authority management role with anyone report like officially reporting to them rather they're collaborative and use influence and they certainly have resources assigned to them and they manage them but project managers my experience are typically more facilitator than bosses we'll talk a little bit more about that later definitely possible for project managers to be both to have these dual rules and maybe even more all depends on the right fit and how do you tailor project management for your organization the team leader cannot act like a boss and still obtain the benefits of team based work i think it's really important to call that out that this kind of team leader doesn't go around issuing orders we're not in the military here and we'll talk more as said about bosses versus leaders in a little while so what kind of things do a does it does the team lead role do what are they responsible for i'm not gonna read all of these things but you know it's what's important here is the breath of things you know they're an ini they demonstrate initiative they model their own behavior they're able to effectively negotiate you can't be a good negotiator with being good listener you know projects are gonna encounter challenges or or blockers team leads have a a a significant responsibility to help coach people whether it's a learning new skills or how to deal with a problem or how to keep the the work on track all of those things could benefit from a team lead coaching the team members and then often the team lead also is actually doing at least some of the work a a common pattern it actually is for the team need to take some of the least popular work to just i guess literally to take one for the team and to free up the more desirable work for team members so team members we really important not to overlook this without team members the heavy lifting of the project would never get done and that's that's why it's so important that we make sure that we have the right people on the team so how do you decide who to put on a team well you know technical skills are very important we need to align that with the work that needs to get done but in general problem solving skills are always gonna be important as our interpersonal skills especially the ability to collaborate with other people remember this is a team or you know and here at at cones it's like a group project you you have to be able to work effectively with other people the last one is organizational skills which you know enable anyone to get things done so those are some key criteria for how to choose team members so this is stakeholders i took this definition from a pm article that looks at stakeholder analysis which is a a larger topic but once again in the bucket i didn't and at least in this chapter i didn't see what i was looking for so i wanna spend a better of time in this that stakeholders are individuals and organizations who are actively involved in the project or whose interest may be positively are ne negatively affected as a result of that project so this could include a wide variety of people and there's even a a a a broader definition if you look at the at the bottom box there you know the broadest definition of stakeholder this is again from the article from the from pm is it could be anyone who makes a claim on our attention or resources now we're in the future so you know definitely this is gonna include the project manager customer team members and the project sponsor for sure but you know if in my experience especially as projects get larger customer you're gonna see the stakeholder group include vendors suppliers and partners and and other people like that or organizations like that and that's it for project management roles
Unit 2.3 - Topic 2 - PM as Conductor.webm: so next we'll take a look at project manager as conductor so what does that mean well the opening of and one point three has a very nice comparison or a metaphor of project managers as the conductor of an orchestra so in the unit folder i i have a link to a youtube video certainly you're not required to see it but if not familiar or or interested in exactly what a conductor does in an orchestra then i think it's a great video that will help you better understand that so before we talk about project managers as doctors let's take a quick minute to just think about projects as as an orchestra so orchestra is a a a group of musicians who play together typically classical music or opera or things like that you know both have many many members each has a different role team members belong to different units and to the larger team at the same time so in the orchestra whether your strings wood wings brass or per precaution or in an it organization sales marketing development manufacturing shipping whatever you know what's important here is they each each of those teams and each member have their own part to play and that successes depend on everyone doing the work in coordination with everyone else you can't play the symphony if everyone isn't playing at the same time and literally playing from the same song sheet and this is a very nice metaphor for completing a project okay so with that let's take a look at project manager as conductor so the conductor of the orchestra is responsible for what the orchestra produces the the music and the project manager in the exact same way is responsible what the project team produces so this means that each of them needs a holistic view and their interpretation this is very important you can't be a great conductor by focusing just on the violin and there's there isn't enough in the documentation of the orchestra the the sheet music to fully bring that piece of music to life there's enough for the conductor and the musicians to do that but there's a level of interpretation that needs to happen there as well and that that's true of a project as well the other thing that's very important is that the the conductor and the project manager they need to make sure there's an alignment of vision mission and objectives of the organization so that doesn't mean you have to do everything and know everything that's certainly not the case conductors for example don't know how to play every instrument but they're an expert in orchestra music and they provide leadership planning and coordination the same way project managers don't know how to do every job but they're an expert in project management and they provide leadership planning and coordination so given that what what what do we see is in high performing project managers and i think this is once again very close to what we seen in high performing conductors but we're not quite as interested in the actual work of high performing conductors so you know communicates two key things here communication and relationship management now in the in the work in the pm box you're gonna notice quite a bit of material here around all the different ways that you can communicate and a very full description here of of what that means and i think that's excellent however if you look at the relationship management content it's quite a bit shorter so i'm gonna spend more time talking about that because to me they're equally important and i i think that we need to have a little little bit better understanding of of what relationship management means so broadly speaking it's networking formal in and informal but it's the quality in your ability to connect with people to relate with them but also to be able to engage them and get them on side get them to support the project and when you have a problem to be able to go with go to whoever in the organization or potentially even beyond the organization and find an ally find a friend who's gonna help the project a deal in the best way with that with that blocker or with that challenge i will say one of the things i really do like in this section of the book is talking about how important informal relationships are so the formal relationships those are reporting lines those are like my manager and the people who report to me the people in hr or the people in it things like that particularly as they relate to my role what's really powerful those the informal relationships for two reasons one i think often in informal relationships are closer to friendships and can be stronger but also those informal relationships aren't bound by the org chart they're not siloed in the same way it's much easier to to cross the different of business units or even to a past colleague at another company or a friend who's an expert in something all of those kinds of things come together so what is really important here is that we need to be clear that project managers need to be excellent communicators and we have a very good list here of all the ways that we need to be able to do that but also i want to make sure that you have a very clear understanding of how important relationship management is so that as a project manager you wanna make sure that you're always nurturing and fostering positive relationships with as many people within your organization as you can and that you do that from a place of mutual not transactions so what i mean by that is you should ask how can we help each other not i need you to do this for me people and that's part of relationship management is making sure that the relationship is equitable and fair and mutual and you just don't pick up the phone or knock someone's door to say hey i need this can you give it to me now because i think we can all imagine if the rules were reversed we wouldn't like that very much so keep in mind how important these two key skills are when you're thinking about how project managers do their job and how you can either do that work yourself or work with project managers and that's it for project manager as conductor
Unit 2.3 - Topic 3 - PM Spheres of Influence.webm: so next we'll take a look at project manager spheres of influence so what this refers to is there's this diagram in the pm box that looks at these concentric circles of the project managers and the different spheres of influence that they need to operate in and so first we have the project manager themselves and then the project the organization and then the industry so let's first start by taking a look at the project so this is the project itself this is the strongest fear of influence because the project manager is has the authority and responsibility and accountability for the success of that project so your role as a project manager or if you're working with the product project managers that they're gonna provide direction and present that vision for success so once again we see that list of of communication skills and relationship management these are the core skills that that project managers need to use yeah in influencing the the sphere of the project so beyond the project is the larger organization this is the organization that's running the project you know in key influences with other project managers that's because you're gonna be working with them around prioritization of of the different projects resource allocation strategic alignment if you have a a program management office or a portfolio management office then this is where you're gonna see those roles really come into play in the diagram you see ppp managers that's project portfolio program portfolio managers but the other thing is the project manager of a project they're the the advocate for a project throughout the entire organization certainly the sponsor has an important role to play and needs to model strong support but you you are as the project manager you're gonna be the face the identity that represents that project you'll be providing the leadership ensuring the vision you'll be typically doing the updates upstream to senior management or or the c level or coordinating with your portfolio or program management offices for those kinds of updates not only that but you're gonna need to collaborate with project sponsors to navigate political and strategic issue so as issues that are beyond your influence to to negotiate or to deal with present themselves you're gonna go back to the project sponsors so that they can clear the way or come up with a new plan to mitigate whatever that whatever that issue is so then next we have the industry and this is the entire effectively the rest of the world but typically it's gonna be other organizations within within the same industry that you're in so it's very important that project managers need stay current on industry news and trends being an expert or at least someone who's well educated in the industry so let's say it or higher ed for example the credibility and trust with external stakeholders and vendors depends on this knowledge so it to be able to establish that you need to you know know your industry and be able to connect with those external people and internally as well to demonstrate that you understand that you the other thing that i i think it's really important i i don't really see this in in the pm box but to me this is very important is that project managers need to really know what's happening in the marketplace in the actual end users and the customers of of whatever your problem you're solving now maybe that project is fully internal maybe it's migrating to a new support ticket system alright well you still need to make sure that you're talking to the people who need help with a lost password or a lost phone or or whatever the situation is but especially if the project affects actual customers outside of the building end users then that industry knowledge is really important so that you're able to have a clear understanding and the right foundation to build able to empathize with and understand the problems and the setting the context of what the project is delivering not only that the the last big piece of why this industry part of the sphere influence is important to engage with and be part of is you get to see what other organizations are doing you can follow those strategies you also can be inspired to innovate internally so just to just to look at that diagram one more time these are the concentric circles of the spheres of influence at the center of it is project managers the next one is the the project sphere and that's you know the rest of the project team the project program and portfolio managers and resource managers so those will be the people who will provide team members to your team or or resources or services internally the next level up is the organization there we see sponsors a governing body that might be a steering committee or the board of directors or change advisory board or or possible things we'd could see there and then lastly the full program or portfolio manage office and then at the largest level is just the the whole industry and even beyond honestly but you know wouldn't don't wanna say that you have to know everything about everything so in that industry we see stakeholders suppliers vendors customers end users so it's very important that we're able to identify those the the the trends in the industry have the right news and be up to date and be able to follow the context of the industry so that we're educated and informed and can bring that to our work for the best outcomes for the project and that is it for spheres of influence
Unit 2.3 - Topic 4 - PM Competencies.webm: next we'll take a look at project manager competencies so the competencies begin with the talent triangle in the pm box in there three key pieces to that technical project management skills strategic and business management skills and then lastly leadership just so we're clear that's you know project management the actual technical skills of that then overall strategy business and then lastly leading people so let's take a look at the technical pm skills these are defined by the skills to effectively apply project management knowledge to deliver the desired outcomes for programs or projects a bit of a non definition it's a little bit saying you know product management skills of the skills to be able to run a project fair enough there is a focus on some critical elements around making sure that you understand how product projects will be successful schedule financial reports and and issue log but also tailoring traditional and agile tools and all the practices for each project we've talked about this before and the tailoring section how important it is that there is not one way to run a project and there isn't any one thing in the pm box that has to be in all projects each project needs to be assessed and the project management techniques and process has to be tailored to it now typically in an organization there will be some strong standards that are a good fit or match for the organization already and the kinds of projects that are taken on but it's always still important as a project manager to look at each project as you're putting together the plan and make sure that you don't have anything that's not needed that's gonna take up extra time or resources or any gaps in process either so of course making time to plan and prioritize diligently i wanna be really clear that the the language here and i really like that they used the the phrase make time this is so important because it's very easy to get buried or swamped or overwhelmed by all the different things that come with successfully running a project and very often a project manager could have more than one project they're responsible for or other duties or responsibilities beyond running that project making sure you defend your time is extremely important important and that means i would suggest scheduling time on a weekly basis or more frequently if if needed blocking it out in the calendar finding a quiet place to work turning off your phone or being unavailable on messenger these are all important tasks not reading email focus time where they're you're not gonna be interrupted and you're able to make sure that the planning and prioritization that's needed for the project to get on track and stay on track is something that you really can't afford to skip as a project manager certainly my my own personal experience people are gonna come to you with problems and challenges all the time and you're your instinct was my instinct is to say yes to everyone it's really important that you're able to prioritize those tasks because somebody asks for help doesn't mean you have to help them right away so if somebody comes to the challenge or a blocker on the project very important things in with an it background you're probably familiar with considering things like severity and impact for support ticket you know if someone says hey well i'm not able to move forward with my work i'll say alright how important is this and how much what does this impact alright do we have to talk about this now or if we talk about it tomorrow or early next week or something like that would be the kinds of strategies that i would recommend lastly managed project elements including but limited to scheduled cost resources and those are the the primary parts that you that you'll need to to manage so one thing to to finish with is that while these skills are core to program and project management they're also not enough in today's world for a successful project managers that's why you see these other two dimensions of strategic and business skills as well as leadership i mentioned this it's in the in the text but also i mentioned this because it would be reasonable for you to say well why are we talking about anything beyond project management skills around being a project manager and that's because in today's market it takes the the the technical skills being a project manager but you also need some strategic and business skills and the ability to be the ability to be a leader so let's take a look now at strategic and business skills here we have this defined as the ability to see high level overview of the organization and effectively negotiate and implement decisions and actions so that that's one another one of these very broad general definitions but it over the key takeaway here is the ability to make a decision at a high level so that's an analysis plus decision and then be able to negotiate and implement or execute on the on that decision to make sure that it actually gets done so this could certainly one way that strategic and business skills present themselves in the project manager would be other functions that are common to the operations of an enterprise such as marketing finance or operations i could also include product or industry experience certainly software it would be good examples of that but it could be anything petrochemical manufacturing of financial instruments but it's really important that as a project manager you have sufficient business knowledge about the project about the organization about the industry that you're working in because you have to be able to communicate about it it's very hard to communicate about something that you don't know enough about but also you need be to work with the the project sponsor team and subject matter experts develop the project strategy and plan and clearly you need to have enough foundation in the actual business space to be able to do that but lastly you also wanna be able to implement that strategy to get the most out of the project and the project team and the opportunity so the all those things come together under strategic and business skills another part of strategic and business skills though is just straight organizational knowledge so in terms of i i mean the information about the organization that you work for so you need to be able to be able to really understand and communicate the strategy mission all these other things on on the list pay particular attention to attention to competitive landscape i i think that's something that's often overlooked but you need to know your organization because we've talked so many times already about needing to provide vision to provide interpretation to work with the sponsor to make sure that the project is aligned with strategic goals for the business furthermore to work with the program or portfolio office on strategic prioritization of resources and projects if you don't have this information our about the organization then those conversations is are gonna be very difficult to have and it will very unlikely be successful in those conversations there's also some business in strategic factors that should be looked at and understood so this is a little bit more on the business side but really understanding things like risk and issues cost versus benefit benefit value if you go back to that project benefit plan or the project case on around the initiation when you're providing the business case for the project and the listing of the the benefits these are the kinds of pieces that really help inform that kind of report and we'll give you the the confidence and the expertise to be able to make those assessments really wanna make sure that we're clear that these aren't snapshot pieces of information things like strategy envision those do change but on a slower cadence but these things things like cost versus benefit a a competitive landscape scope budget quality all those kinds of things these evolve over time and and they change a relatively quick pace so project managers need to be continuously working with the sponsors or anyone else who is who's available and and and necessary for that process but especially with sponsors to align the project with these kinds of factors so that wraps up the second piece in terms of business and strategic skills so that third part of the talent triangle is leadership and we define leadership here as the ability to guide motivate and direct to team so that includes a number of skills that are listed here i i think we probably all have a good idea of what leadership is we've all worked with people who are who are strong leaders and weaker leaders i think we've also encountered the difference perhaps between leadership and management and i really appreciate that this section of the pm box spends time looking at that difference between leadership and management so you know leadership is about collaboration influence engagement management is more about directing work now i wanna be clear there isn't a good and a bad here that each have their place and project managers will need to use both leadership and management to be successful ultimately both are about how you deal with people we've already talked about relationships we've already talked about interpersonal skills and things like that how you deal with people is critical to your access as a product manager and finding the balance when's the right time to use leadership skills versus management skills is is very important so the pm ba in in this section has a a very nice comparison chart and i'm not gonna read the whole thing here but i didn't can get a sense on you know management is very you know checking off tasks making sure things are done directing or telling people what to do a very clear assessment of success based on what it's accomplished or the bottom line and a very operational focus you might think or i think of management as being very tactical leadership is more about you know innovating focusing on relationships inspiring understanding focusing on the future doing the right thing and in that that whole focus on vision and alignment and motivation and inspiration this is more strategic overall that that's one of the ways i would think about this once again i just wanna really emphasize that there isn't there is not a right and wrong here there's different tools and at different times you'll you'll need each of them but the thing that brings them together is that they're both about getting things done and you need to understand which tools to use at which time there there's no math or equation i can tell you on which to use when there's something about judgment and experience you need to bring to that but i think the if if you don't if if that really doesn't if that seems very confusing to you or you don't understand what i mean by that i encourage you to reflect on your own experiences when you've been managed versus when you've been led and when it worked and when it didn't now something's really important here is that you know there's a reality that we're dealing with politics and power here so you know politics is all about influencing negotiation autonomy and and power so you know whether this vp or that vp is supporting or not whether your sponsor has changed their mind and they're no longer interested in this particular project if there's contention in the program management office between the prioritization of different different projects and you you're getting caught in the middle these are all really difficult and challenging things now power is often supported by other people's perception of the leader so it's really important that project managers are aware of their relationship of the people this is a real theme that you're that you that what we're seeing here on how important relationships are so you know this sort of culminate in terms of the relationships this statement here relationships enable project managers to get things done on the project so whether you're using management skills or leadership skills ultimately they were rely on relationships and how you work with other people to get things done now there's a lot of different modes of power and so i definitely won't read all these and they're all listed in in the book what i wanna focus on isn't the number of them there's a there's a lot and and some of them are relatively similar i don't know have a a huge difference between all of them oh or sorry some of them but the four that i've highlighted in orange i'd like you to just look at them for a moment and think about why did i highlight those particular four so these are not the types of power that i would i typically think should be you i'm not saying there's no place for them ever but they have a cost in terms of trust morale and emotional safety in the workplace i'm sure you've probably had an experience where somebody simply told you what to do and didn't explain why or how or somebody put pressure on you or gil you into something or they've simply avoided you and until you got did that thing that that they asked you to do and those probably didn't feel very good you'll also note that i didn't highlight punitive or c right here so i wanna be clear that you know there is a place for that but we have to be very careful here so you know we wanna tread lightly because using that kind of power or yeah that kind of power comes out of at a at a cost but something like putting some on a performance improvement plan which is like a written warning and a plan on how to how to improve their performance before they they meet with a stronger consequence it's something that's it's legitimate it's important i've seen it work if somebody is not following the rules if someone's being disrespectful or harassing colleagues and you know they they there needs to be a clear consequence in terms of how that's written up and how they're directed to change their behavior to meet the requirements and standards of the workplace and lastly it it it is important that an involuntary exit being like oh needs to be on the table if somebody isn't the right fit and they can't do the job or won't do the job then it's important that that they're able to be exited from the organization so you know punitive course of i never my first move i live very much in the in the persuasive relational charismatic kind of kind of power but wanted to make sure that we reviewed those four in particular and created some room and understanding around the importance of punitive power i do wanna spend a little bit of time talking about leader versus boss so we talked about leadership versus management and then there's isn't a good and bad i'm gonna suggest here that the that there's a strong preference for of being a leader over being a boss now you'll notice there are some alignments between boss and manager in terms of that being directive and things like that but it goes deeper than that and on the left hand side here we have a number of different things and i there's some really important things here places blame for the breakdown and instead of fixing the breakdown knows how it's done instead of showing how it's done uses people's of develops people takes credits that it gives credit commands as instead have asks now some of those behaviors some of the time are gonna be fine but i think things like using people or taking credit the those aren't positive behaviors they're not going to earn you trust and loyalty and they're not gonna be very effective if there's a one other way to talk about how i think the difference between leaders and bosses is that leaders expect to work with the team and bosses expect the team to work for them and in my experience both being on project teams and being a project manager trying to be a boss isn't gonna be very effective we're not there to tell people what to do where there to share the plan we've developed and engage the team to collaboratively come together be inspired by that vision and work together to get the work done there's a number of different leadership styles as well let's fair is sort of let's letting people do their own thing it's hands off transactional is providing some very clear rewards or incentives servant leadership demonstrates a commitment to serve transformational where you're really trying to empower your followers through you know behaviors and inspirational motivation encouragement to innovate creativity things like that charismatic is about being high energy enthusiastic self confident in international is a a combination of those things i don't think we need to spend a lot more time on that it's not covered in depth in the pm bob but i think it is important under and there are different leadership styles in understanding where your strengths are is important but we're gonna come back to that in just a moment and the other thing i wanna touch on is the different personality traits that are talked here these intersect with leadership style both in terms of how you what your personality trains are and how you're gonna connect and what kind of relationships you're gonna but also this is a useful way to map the other relationships on a project team or throughout your organization those spheres of influence so that you have an idea of how those of how different people are gonna react and how you can tailor especially your your communications and just and also your leadership to the personality traits of the people that that you're serving as leader now i i said i was gonna talk about those excuse me i said i was talk about having the right situation for other people and in about leadership styles so i wanna just this is not in the pm box and i i've included a link to this in on the online course but i wanted to introduce you to the idea of situational leadership which shifts away from the idea of saying my leadership style is and then telling people how they have to work for you or or or what kind of leadership you're gonna provide and instead shifts towards the leadership style needed in this situation is and so understanding the different types of power understanding the different leadership styles the different kind of personalities that you have on your project team and in your sphere of influence and your stakeholders you know this to this creates a a particular situation and as this chart shows you can have a a couple of different options on how you are a leader whether you're directing coaching supporting or delegate depending on the needs of the situation and those needs are based on two factors around whether around that person's competence and commitment i'm not gonna go too much more into that it's not in the pm box if you haven't heard of situation leadership i really encourage you to take a look at the article that i've included and take a look at integrating some of that into your leadership practices with that that wraps up unit two point three so i'll remind you and encourage you to ask questions on the discussion form and that please keep an eye out to see if there's any questions you can answer and i'm always gonna be looking at that information as well to answer your questions for you as part of our time together thanks so much and that's it for unit two point three
Unit 3.1 - Topic 1 - Project Integration Management.webm: hello and welcome to unit three project management practices in this unit we have two key contact concepts project integration management and managing the triple constraint would you complete this unit you'll will be able to describe project integration and project best practices you'll also be able to to describe develop and demonstrate the use of a project charter and lastly you'll be able to describe and apply the triple constraint of project management we have two unit subunits the first is project integration and the second is managing the triple constraint in terms of resources for this unit all of part of section one point four of the pm box is required and as this is not a certification course we won't be looking at all of the sections one point five through seven but please ensure you read the intro to each section and the first subs section on how to plan how how to plan to manage scope schedule and cost okay so let's take a look at project management integration we have several topics here so let's get started with prod with the introduction to project integration management overall so what is project integration management well from the pm box it's going to define it as a a bunch of different activities but simply put project management integration is all about putting the pieces of the project together and ensuring they fit this would be a good time to look back and remember on the idea of project manager as a conductor of an orchestra pulling together all the different members of the of the project team and beyond well within those different spheres of influence in making sure that they all work together for the right outcome a successful project there's a number of choices or decisions that are gonna happen during project integration from resource allocation to balancing competing demands i i won't read the whole list you can take a look at it there but you can see that this is very much about coordination or orchestration so that's something to keep in mind throughout this topic so what are the key concepts of project management integration well the first thing to start with is how fundamental this part of of the pm ba in these activities are to the function of a successful project manager this really covers the core of project management you know understanding bringing together directing and combining all the elements of the project it's also very important to keep in mind that these activities of project integration management are typically not done a single time they're most often gonna be iterative either within the project or phase or through the project process groups so let's take a look at the project integration activities as listed in the pm box i'm not gonna read this whole slide to you i did wanna in highlight each of the verbs here we can see a real pattern here of ensuring providing collecting managing those kinds of activities what's really important here is to both understand the scope of these activities but also that the more complex and the more varied the expectations of the stakeholders the more sophisticated an approach to integration is needed we've already talked quite a bit about how every project is unique and we need to bring the right set of tools and practices each project this is true of each phase of each project as well and that's what this is all about so ensuring that the deliverable due dates of the product service or result so that the benefits of the plan are aligned that's that's the first activity there i wanted to touch on one of them please take a look at the rest of the list here as well so let's talk a little bit more about project tailoring there are eight ways that a tailor project can be tailored that's listed here but we've already talked a project life cycle in terms of development life lifecycle this is gonna be very much dependent on the kind of organization but let's talk about it software we we've already talked about things like agile do do we want something adaptive or more predictive management approaches that's gonna be based on the organizational culture and complexity of the of the project itself how much knowledge management is needed do you need a knowledge base do you need formal documentation with with change logs or is a wiki sufficient those kinds of things change is really important as we talked at the beginning of this course this entire course really is about change management so understanding how how our changes documented but also approved within the project are very important we we've talked about these other things before governments particularly who's the sponsor or what stakeholders are are gonna have the authority to both support but also provide direction to the project and then in terms of the outputs of the project how do we want to frame lessons learned and so if we don't know that at the beginning of the project we may miss the opportunity to document those things and then lastly how do we report on the benefit do we do that at the end of each phase each iteration or only at the end of the project so this is from the pm box and has the full project integration management overview here i won't go through this particular diagram step by step because that's really what the rest of this unit is gonna be about this provides a structure for the topics that we'll be talking about so with that let's take a look at that first one and which will be to develop a project charter
Unit 3.1 - Topic 2 - Develop Project Charter.webm: next we'll be taking look at how to develop a project charter so from the pm box the definition of this part of project integration is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project it also provides the authority for resources and other activities within the organization there's a very useful process chart that outlines the inputs the tools and techniques and the outputs and we will go over all of this in this topic i also wanna point out this project charter flow chart that's provided in the pm box as well i wanna assure you that you don't need to memorize this and i don't want you to stress or feel anxious over the size and complexity of this flow chart this is an exhaustive documented process which means it lists all the possibilities typically i don't think you'd ever choose all of these this is a little bit like the pm box overall there's a lot of information but what's important that you understand the best practices value of each of those and then you can tailor which parts you bring to your project management practices so let's start off by looking at those project charter inputs there are four key things here business documents agreements enterprise environmental factors in organizational process audit assets and you can see that three of these we've already talked about so far these are very important fundamental concepts and project management business documents ee and op agreements have been implicit in our conversations and we'll have an opportunity to explore that a little bit more here at a high level the business case and the benefits management plan are used to describe the projects objectives and document how the project will contribute to the business goals these would always be developed before the project starts but that doesn't mean you don't return to them definitely for alignment checking when we're talking about monitor and control over a project but it's possible that might even get updated throughout the process of the project agreements are gonna be things like contracts memorandum of understanding service service level agreements letters of agreements all those kinds of things could even potentially just be a verbal agreement and email instant message those things i i would typically say the more formal the method of documentation probably the better position positioning you're gonna be in you don't wanna have the fate of a project rely on a text or an instant message or something like that these are you know often legal agreements but don't necessarily i have to be they're used when a project is being performed for an external customer typically you don't need to have this level of agreement within an organization project charters act actually are the right way to manage that overall so we don't need to sort of double down on that for internal agreements so environmental enterprise factors we've already talked about some of these sorry we already talked about the idea this is an important time to come back to those ee and see how they influence when we develop a project charter so there are definitely things like government orange industry standards organizational culture and political climate the organizational governance framework stakeholder expectations there are others as well we've already talked about ef so i won't go too much further on that but you can definitely see i hope how the environment of the enterprise is a very significant factor in what influences the project charter that project charter is the formal agreement that there is going to be a project why what it will accomplish who will do it what resources will be used so clearly the ee play a big role in that of course op organizational process assets can also be an important part of this as well definitely things like the portfolio program or approach governance framework monitoring and reporting methods templates this is probably the most important part of op in my opinion the is what are the opinion sorry what are the templates what are the artifacts the documents we need to generate throughout the process of the entire project and making sure we're consistent and have alignment with other both other project but also with the portfolio program project practices of the organization of course we don't wanna forget about historical information such as past projects that are related lessons learned and other things like that let's take a little bit closer of a look at the business document business documents rather we already talked about the business case this is a very very important document to the project charter it's really the foundation of the project charter and i wanted to make sure that we took a look at a few things here there's a list of things in the in the pm box around what the what feeds into the business case and they're all very important and i don't want to take away from any of those but i do wanna highlight these last two here of ecological impacts and social need the reason i want to highlight these is because i think they're often forgotten or not necessarily seen initially as being important parts of a business case so just to be super clear ecological impacts includes things when a company is initiating a project to improve its environmental impact by lessen negative impacts or some other work and then on social need looking at what the benefit is to a society in general or a community or something like that these are all very important i think you might see those ecological impacts and social needs more often in an offer profit or charitable situation but certainly that's not necessary and i'd really encourage you to make sure that you're thinking through those elements in any business case that you put together so we're moving from the inputs part of the process remember the process had three steps input tools and techniques and output so this is that middle part and there are three key tools and techniques expert judgment interpersonal and team skills and meetings so in terms of expert judgment this is gonna be all part of making sure that you have enough understanding and expertise in project management but also that you're bringing in enough other team members with expertise in this particular knowledge area a discipline industry whatever needs whatever the requirements of the project are that we bring in the sufficient expertise so that we can effectively write a project charter that will result in a successful project in terms of interpersonal and team skills i i think i missed something on this slide data gathering it is another one on here apologies i see it in my notes but it's not on the slide this is gonna include things like brainstorming focus groups and interviews in terms of interpersonal and team skills you know things are these are about how do you bring people together you want this is already in the project charter staff when you're developed there's already you have that broad need to bring together many different voices stakeholders team members experts and bring together a plan and that already has a tremendous mode of integration and collaboration required so you know the the interpersonal and team skills are in include things like conflict management facilitation and meeting management and then the last technique or tool technique here is just meetings because this is gonna be a multi stakeholder collaborative because there's gonna be multiple teams and we already talked about how the different spheres of influence overlap for the project manager there's really no way to be able to coordinate all these people other than having meetings so those meetings are going to for the project charter or developing the project charter are gonna include things like key stakeholders to identify the objectives the success criteria what is gonna be delivered what are the requirements when are we gonna provide summary milestones and all those other kinds of things one of the things i think is really interesting about meetings that it really brings together the other three types expert judgment data gathering and interpersonal and team skills alright so that was the middle we've there was a three step process for project charter the inputs the tools and techniques and the outputs so let's wrap up this now by taking a look at the project charter outputs there's a whole lot of things here i'm not gonna read all of these but you could think of these as potentially the sections of your project charter or the things that need to be addressed in the project charter so a couple of things i wanna highlight is project approvals sorry i project approval requirements this one is important because this is what constitutes project success who decides that the project is successful and who signs off on the project if you don't have a clarity on that you run the risk of never knowing when you're actually done and or having somebody who isn't qualified or is not appropriate determined that your project did not succeed potentially and then the other one is project exit criteria which is what are the conditions that need to be met to design that the project is ready ready to be closed or that the project with that phase needs to be canceled lastly the other thing to think about potentially is an assumption log this is a high level strategic an operational assessment of all the assumptions constraints that are part of the business case and typically this is done before the project is initiated and could be included in the project charter we probably aren't gonna do lower level activities here typically it's gonna be for at a at a higher more strategic level but overall the assumption log is used to record all the assumption assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle so this would be one place that so the reason this is a little bit different than the the output is that this is a running tally or ongoing documentation throughout the project of the assumptions and that wraps up how to develop a project charter
Unit 3.1 - Topic 3 - Develop PM Plan.webm: next we'll take a look at develop project management plan so to define this this is the process of defining preparing and coordinating all plan components in consolidating them into an integrated project management plan this is doing the work of the planning of the project so we'll start to see a very clear pattern with how the pm box provides this information in this section that's gonna show a set of inputs it's gonna show tools and technique it's gonna show a set of outputs for each section so here's a a review of all those steps for develop project management plan i'm i include the flow chart in each of these for reference i'm not gonna require you to know these flow charts and typically this one's quite simple but typically they're quite complex because they're intended to be exhaustive to list every possible option so great for planning wonderful reference material not the kind of thing that you're gonna need to recall definitely i could see the need or benefit in referring to these kinds of flow chart so during your assignment work so keep that in mind if you would want direction on that in terms of the assignments just let me know so what does the project plan scope look like we just wanna be really clear on on planning scope i the big takeaway here the thing i want you to remember is that project plans can be detailed or they can be summary and i would say in the real world they lean to summary more than detailed now the more expensive the project the more at stake the more it makes sense to invest in more detail but as a general rule i would suggest that you aim for sufficiency so be robust make sure you have everything that the project needs but we don't need to completely document every every possible thing as we go through these sections you'll see there's long lists of sort of ee and op and business documents and so i won't sort of go through every single option please be sure to review this material in the pm box in the required reading however in terms of what's required to know i i will provide i'll i'll sort of mention the important ones as we go through in in these topics and then lastly it's beneficial to have a baseline set of planning to compare a cost scope and schedule of past projects we'll talk about it a little bit more i would once again say in the real world i i've rarely seen strong baseline documentation it it typically it's more tac knowledge so you'll talk to more experienced people to review a a plan or a proposal and they'll provide some guidance on thing on on how you've structured the cost scope and schedule and things like that okay so let's what are the inputs for the project plan well not surprisingly the project charter features very prominently here this is typically the starting point for any project planning you know on a minimum that project charger should define the high level information of the project and then the plan can elaborate or help describe and in the details on that there's lots of other processes this is one of my least favorite inputs in this section because it's so generic but there's lots of subsidiary plans and baseline that can be used in terms of environmental enterprise factors the key things here are government or indeed industry standards and legal or regulatory requirements also think about the structure of your organization the culture the management practices and the governance framework for your organization if that sounds very broad it's because it's extremely broad it's that's roughly saying you need to consider all the things about the environment that you're planning your project in and then lastly organizational process assets lots of things here too this is very broad here as well you know important things are gonna be you know guidelines and templates for how to document project plans what your change control procedures are how you monitor and report and then the information from past projects both in terms of baseline information but also in terms of lessons learned once again this is very broad in the other topics for this section you'll see that narrowed down as we get to the individual phases or or different parts of project integration project plan is the whole project so of course this the material here indicates that each of these things each of the inputs are quite broad so let's take a look at the project plan tools and techniques a common theme you'll see in tools and techniques are what you see here there's that not a lot of deviation from from step to step or from integration step to integration step here expert judgment is very important you know there's a you know lots of sayings around you know measure twice cut once or you know the importance of planning certainly that applies here as well in terms of data gathering you know we can look at things like brainstorming checklist focus groups and interviews we talked about this before i'll note that checklists are included for a project planning and i really like this i'm a big fan checklists because they're simple and easy way to document process flows and they give everyone on the team and opportunity to speak up if something isn't checked off so you know many organizations already have standardized checklists that's based on their experience or come from industry knowledge like a best practices guide or something like that so if you have access to those i would definitely recommend that you take a look at that very good for documenting the steps and ensuring that things happened in the right order so into personal team skills here not much of a surprise there pretty standard thoughts on this in the pm box talking about conflict management facilitation and meeting management but let's talk a little bit more about meetings there is a particular focus on something called the project kickoff meeting which just a the the very first meeting where you end the planning and start executing so the purpose of this is to make sure that you're able to align and communicate the objectives the goals of the project get buy in and support from the team make sure everyone has the same understanding about roles and responsibilities and the kickoff could happen at different times depending on the on the needs of your project but typically it's it's right at the very beginning it's also worthwhile to mention that small projects often we'll have a single team for all of the work so that that definitely simplifies this in larger projects project management teams normally do the majority of planning and the remainder of the project could be brought on when the initial planning is complete and you're d up the work and and signing it out if you have a very long project which could be small or large but what i mean by this is a multi phase project typically there'll be a kickoff meeting at the beginning of each phase so what are the outputs of the project plan well the project plan itself is the key one we did mention those subsidiary plans before four so we'll take a closer look at that in a moment and there's a wide range of plans and in terms of other outputs just baseline lines or or additional components again that additional components is very generic well i i'm not gonna dive into it because it's not it's not essential or core knowledge but please make sure that you do review that in the reading so let's take a look at the subsidiary plans lots of things here i'm not gonna go over all of them but i do think the scope management plan is particularly important stakeholder engagement i'm gonna so i i'm gonna start with the first one and the last one that just put a little bit of emphasis is on those one you know in terms of scope management this is about how we ensure that we have agreement on how scope will be defined and then how do we manage scope throughout the projects so that's about not only defining the scope but monitoring and controlling and validating that we've that we're on track with that scope in the last one on the list of subsidiary plans is stakeholder management i i want to make sure you're very clear or sort of state of the stakeholder engagement plan was a part of what i would refer to as stakeholder management i want you to be clear on how important stakeholder engagement is to success of a project these are the people that are going to ultimately judge or approve the success failure the completion of the project and if we lose their support of the project could fail or stall out so please be really focused on this i think i think i'm a relatively common error for junior pro project managers to not fully understand the importance of stakeholder engagement so here we have a long list of all the documents and this comes straight out of the pm box it's a definitely an eye chart this is a way too small read and i don't expect you to read it you can take a look at the table in and the pm box but what i wanted to do is just give you a sense of how many of their documents are are possible and specified and once again this is all about tailoring a project to your needs i can't imagine a project that would need every single one of these and so you you we need to make sure that you know we talked to or at the beginning of this topic about making sure we're aiming for sufficiency and robustness but not necessarily being complete it was no value and being complete in and of itself so while these other documents might not be directly in the project management plan they certainly could be necessary to manage the project successfully so this is a representative list of all the kinds of planned components and project documents that might be available sort of that are available and and might be used in a particular project and that is a develop project management plan
Unit 3.1 - Topic 4 - Direct and Manage Project Work.webm: next we have direct and manage project work so the pm box defines this as the process of leading and forming the work defined in the project management plan and implementing approved changes to achieve the project's objectives i really like this definition because it includes that piece of change so important to remember that your plan will not go according to plan so let's take a quick look at the inputs the tools and techniques so that's a little a preview of what we'll be doing in this topic once again we have quite a complex flow chart here i really want you to not stress over the size how complex this stuff is and really keep in mind that this is sort of a list of all the possible things so important that we are aware of it important that you use it as a resource to see what are the standard best practices but remember how important tailoring is and that you always need to making be making the decisions to choose the right tools and techniques the right processes for your project so let us take a look at direct and manage project work input series of project documents approve change requests and as of as always ef f pe and op so in terms of these inputs the things that i really wanna focus on is the i think we've talked about project documents quite a bit let's talk a little bit more about approved change requests so i an improved change request maybe be a corrective action of preventive action or a defect repair what's important is that these changes acknowledge that things are going to drift or there's gonna be variance from the plan to the execution of the of the project and when we encounter those of that drift or that variance we need to understand what kind of action we need to it it does is any action you did maybe it's fine to simply allow the the the the difference to exist but also we need to understand the governance model for approving and managing those changes in terms of environmental enterprise environmental factors the relevant one the relevant ones here are the structure culture and man practice of your organ organization infrastructure particularly facilities and capital equipment but also thinking about stakeholder risk threshold as what kind of risks are the stakeholders willing to accept and how are you managing those risks as you direct and manage the project work remember in the previous topic i discussed how important stakeholder engagement and management is this is how we see that part of stakeholder engagement in management present itself in this part in this step of project integration in terms of op pas there's a a lot of standard policies process and procedures but we also wanna make sure we're looking at issue in defect management procedures that's how we're going to identify those change requests also whatever the change control and risk control procedures are and then lastly keeping in mind the project information from previous projects to help provide that baseline information in context to help us understand how we're doing compared past behavior there are many different kinds of project documents that could be used for this step the these are the key ones i won't go through them all i will really highlight that project communications without a strong focus on project communications your project will not be successful maintaining alignment and focus making sure everyone's moving in the same direction and that you have support throughout the organization especially the project team the sponsor and the stakeholders this is absolutely critical and the only way to achieve that is with effective and consistent project communication these can include things like performance reports deliverable status and any other kind of status or update from the from the project in it's just so important not only that this is done well but to keep in mind that this is a very important responsibility of the project manager so what kinds of tools and techniques will we use while directing and managing the work well expert judgment once again in this case we're looking at technical knowledge of of course for the industry and the focus of the project but in particular we're looking at cost in budget budget management anything around legal expertise or procurement and we always need to keep an eye on legislation re and regulations and of course organizational governance now we do see something new here in terms of tools and techniques and that's the project management information system also referred to as a pm mis this typically is some sort of software and could be a set of tools they like scheduling work authorization configuration management systems things like that they also could be used to automate gathering and reporting on kpis key performance indicators but that's not a requirement so it's important that we are have good shared documentation and of the project and that's what the pm mis provides it's also important that we're able to generate reports to save us time this part of managing directing and managing work is gonna be highly iterative you're gonna be consistently looking at where the at the status of the project and be able to report on it and direct it so we don't wanna have to spend a lot of calories generating those kinds of reports each time of course meetings are an important part of this so we already talked about that kickoff meeting but there's also technical meetings sprint or iteration planning if you're in agile software development daily scrum stand ups perhaps a steering group updates and retrospective meetings would all be included in that and let's take a look now at what kind of outputs direct to manage project work has this is the first time in this we're starting to see deliverables so let's just take a moment to look closely what our deliverable is a deliverable is any unique and verifiable product result or capability to perform a service that is required to produce to be produced to complete a process phase or project well that's a very technical and highly accurate definition but simply put deliverable is the output of the project it's the reason the the project was initiated it's why we're we're putting the resources in terms of time money and energy into it this is what we deliver as part of the project so very important again i'm gonna really emphasize change requests you know this is defined as that formal proposal to modify any document deliverable or baseline so if there's any change to the project it needs to go through a formal process which is documented and there's a clear decision tree or process on who makes the decision and signs off on it and again we talk about like what kinds of changes are are here typically we see corrective action preventive action defect repair or updates and then lastly we see a bunch of different the bottom three outputs here are all kinds of updates this is so important i i'm if you haven't heard this quote before i'm i'm i'm i'm sure you'll hear it again especially in project management that's that no plan survives contact with the real world you know i i'm a strong believer that ultimately planning is guessing don't forget i talked about change management being the art of predicting the future we you can't know what's gonna happen but you can definitely prepare for it and be well prepared for so i'm not when i say planning is guessing i certainly don't mean that there's no point in planning there's educated guesses and there's an uneducated guesses so but it what's very important here that i want to make sure that you're seeing is how important the update processes or that updates absolutely will be required because as you take your hypothesis you could think of your project plan as a hypothesis as once you start validating in the real world gonna have to make some adjustments and that was direct and manage project work you're
Unit 3.1 - Topic 5 - Manage Project Knowledge.webm: so next we'll take a look at manage project knowledge so this is defined as the process sets of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve the projects objectives and contribute to organizational learning this is very important this is about how you track the what's happening in in the project but it's this is also where an organization is able to level up or iterate and evolve their practices and make sure that we have good resiliency across the organization so that we don't have pockets of information or knowledge that aren't accessible throughout the entire organization so before we dive in i just wanna take some time to talk about the difference between explicit and task knowledge i think the pm box does a very good job of spending some time to look at this and i wanted to make sure that we spend some time on this as well so for the pm bach they define explicit knowledge the knowledge that can easily be seen or learn with words pictures or numbers so easy to communicate easy to document and tac knowledge is personal and difficult to express that can include things like beliefs insight experience and quote unquote know how so in practice knowledge is shared using a mixture of knowledge management tools and techniques that's how people interact and information management tools and techniques that would be a system it could be as simple as a notebook or a bulletin board but it could also be things like the project management confirmation system or a knowledge base and issue tracker all of those kinds of things would be included in this so here's the overview of the process of what the inputs tools and techniques and outputs for manage project knowledge for project integration is and of course we have the flow chart here this is quite a bit simpler than some of the other ones so that's that's nice but once again the these flow charts are a focus of our of our learning in this course so let's take a look at the manage project knowledge input not surprising that project managed plan and project documents would be here deliverables as well end out the standard ef efs and op so relevant project documents let's take a just a moment to sort of unpack what that what those are there's so many options to choose from the important ones for managing project knowledge are lessons learned project team assignments resource breakdown structure and a stakeholder register so understanding who your stakeholders are and what each of their needs are in terms of our environmental factors here you know the organization stakeholder and customer culture so very broad but in particular geographic distribution can be quite important both the facilities at end of personnel who the experts are and what any legal or regulatory requirements are in terms of op pas the relevant items here are personnel admin organizational communication requirements but most importantly knowledge sharing in information sharing procedures in terms of manage project knowledge tools and techniques we see that act expert judgment there so you can see how important those subject matter experts typically inside the organization but sometimes outside of the organization we can see how important they are so the key kind of expertise we're seeking here or we want to bring to this part of our project management are those our experts to our experienced in knowledge and information management organizational learning of the tools we use for those tasks and any relevant information from other projects in larger organizations there might be teams dedicated to this and small organizations it might be bundled with the tasks of of existing teams as an addition to their other work in terms of knowledge management we need to think about how that this is how the pm box refers to that tac knowledge so this is very social so when you look at their knowledge management strategies there's a lot of sort networking or workshops webinars lunch and learns of those kinds of things in terms of information man management this is that explicit information or knowledge so here we're seeing things that are documented and most likely we'll have some sort of inter sorry some sort of infrastructure a wiki or a change management log a knowledge base those kinds of things of course interpersonal and team skills are important here because this is a very much a coordination effort and making sure we can bring together the right information and the right knowledge and make sure that what's sufficiently available for the team and for future teams as well the key skills we're looking for here are things like active listening facilitation leadership networking and political awareness i really like how the pm box consistently brings politics into their discussions it it it might not be ideal but it certainly very relevant and real understanding the political reality of your organization is something that will have a significant impact on the success of your work projects so there are three outputs for manage project knowledge lessons learn register the project management plan updates an op update so once again much like the previous topic we can see how important updates are so please have a very clear and strong understanding that your project plan will absolutely change be modified adjust pivot adapt to the realities of what's happening on the ground and unforeseen circumstances and outcomes certainly every project will face that so it's very important to make sure that we have a clear understanding of that and just to touch quickly back on that lessons learned register the way that organizations can improve their project management practices or any practice going forward is to make sure that you take the time document best practices and lessons learned and make them available in a way that can be shared to to both yourself but also in the future to other projects and other teams and that is manage project knowledge
Unit 3.1 - Topic 6 - Monitor and Control Project Work.webm: next we'll take a look at monitor and control project work so this is defined as the process of tracking reviewing reporting overall progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan we have another one of these very accurate but not particularly helpful definitions so for me this is the core of project management management even the lean project management plan needs to have a very strong focus and sufficient investment in this step to be successful and i wanna take a moment to get cleared on monitoring so this includes you collecting measuring and assessing measurements and trends to affect process improvement so it's watching what's happening and making sure that you're able to make those adjustments as things are going a a common theme in this unit is that as you implement a project you will have to adapt and and and react to the changes to the reality of the things that are different that weren't in your plan and you can't do that if you're not monitoring continuous monitoring is gonna give you the opportunity to understand the health of the project and identify what parts of the project are gonna need extra attention or investment the control part of this is about determining corrective or preventive app actions as you're rep planning and how to follow up to make sure that you're now on track i wanna be really clear but those two options corrective control there's been a been a problem we to correct it or through our monitoring and measurement we can anticipate a likely problem and then take a control take an action to prevent it okay so let's take a look at the inputs tools and technology and outputs for monitor and control project gives you a sense of what we'll take a look at this is pretty detailed and there's a lot here once again i'm going to provide for you the highlights on what is important and strategic we have another relatively complicated flow chart here once again keep in mind that this is not a to do list or a checklist of all the things that you need to do for this part of project integration rather this is a complete list of all the things you could do all of the options that you could exercise think of it as a menu that you could choose from to tailor and fit the project to your needs so let's take a look at the project of the monitor and control project inputs so we have mostly familiar things here the project management plan work performance information that's new on to to this part but agreements e e apps and op we've seen before okay so let's take a look at project management plan so you know here we're going to see the same kinds of things that we've seen before in that plan so we need to make sure that we're following the plan that it's surprising how often all this energy is spent on putting together the plan and then when it comes time to run the project the plan gets put aside and people just sort of do it in an ad hoc way in terms of work performance information what we mean here is the the data that we gather during the the doing of the work to become work performance information the data has to be compared with the plan so the this is key that this work performance information just isn't the measurements it's the comparison of those measurements to the plan and that gives you a performance indicator whether you're on track off track what kind of risk you're in very common language here would be street light language so is the project green yellow or red and that case screen is good yellow is at risk and red is that there's a there's a blocker or a significant problem to give you an example of this work performance data could cover something like cost and in that situation we'd look at the the how much funds or how much money has been spent but to be useful for that to be more than work performance of data for to become work performance information we need to compare that to the budget and the work that was performed and the resources used to accomplish the work in the schedule once we can put all of those things together then we see the work performance information agreements are pretty straightforward especially in the so especially external agreements those typically have higher consequences if they're not followed or if there's some variance or deviation from those agreements but of course internal agreements are just as important such as how you're res or what you're scheduling is you might lose a resource or a resource might need to be moved to another project by a certain time so it's very important that you have that work completed in terms of ef apps we can see you the project management information system that software for managing your your project infrastructure stakeholder expectations and risk thresholds government standards on terms of op pas something that's really important here are what are the financial controls of your organization particular who is signing authority how do you get invoice things like that but also since this entire part of project integration is about monitoring and controlling understanding what the monitoring and reporting methods issue management and defect management those systems and practices are very important to align with and and use so as we take a look at monitor and control project tools and techniques we see very similar list that we've seen in the other segments of project integration here the expert judgment is really looking at how do you interpreting contextualize data what are the techniques to do estimates both in terms of scheduling estimates and cost estimates trend analysis is very important so once you have that work data and then you bring it together with a project plan now you've work information over time you can develop a trend so you can see how we trending positively or trending negatively that can give you an important prediction or advanced understanding of the direction of your project of course always risk management and in this particular point point contract management can be quite important as well so in terms of data analysis you know this is about like what alternatives are there what's the cost benefit analysis if there's a problem what's the root cause we already talked about trend analysis trend analysis and i talked a little bit about variance you know how far off is our cost or our schedule things like that and then how do we how do we how can we bring data to that analysis very important here is decision making so we have sort of three key ways that you could make decisions one is auto automatic there's a single person who just makes decisions that's rarely the project manager probably more something like a sponsor or something like that typically i think this probably isn't the best method of course there there are situations where having a single decision maker simply makes the most sense but we typically a smaller project i would think multi criteria is another one excuse me excuse me sorry multi criteria is another one in this one we'd have a number like this will be using rubrics and scoring and things like that so ahead of time you would have a decision making rubric or a set of criteria and then you're able to use those to score and make decisions sometimes that fits not always not everything can fit easily into a bucket like that and then the last way that's quite common is voting you wanna be very clear on who is getting a vote to make decisions for the project that's definitely something that should be right in the project charter if you have people joining the team you need to be very clear are those are these people joining us at visor or they voting members of of the project i'm not saying one is better and one is worse i'm saying it's very important to be intentional with this and not sort of accidentally or unknowingly increase the number of people are voting that's an important governance control so you need to make sure that how the voting who is identified as a voter is is understood and managed well when we talk about voting there's also three key ways we could think about voting the first is or called consensus this means everyone has to agree this is rarely a a a good way to go it's very difficult to do and in my experience i i've not been very successful with it again if you have a small group or a very high functioning high performing group with lots of trust and experience make maybe that works i'm not saying that it can't work but in my experience it's less successful majority is very common so we need to get the more people that not on an agreement then the last option is plural morality which is we need to have whatever the largest group even if it's less than a majority so a forty percent since say yes but all the other groups are split to to be less than forty percent than that forty percent vote would would win and then of course meetings are accountable to this i won't spend much time on that i will mention that these meetings don't necessarily stay inside the building they certainly could include stakeholders especially outside user groups but but inside those project reviews will be very important as well so in terms of work outputs here now we have work performance reports change requests project plan updates project document updates so once again i'll i'll just observe how important updates are here and to really prepare you for the fact that projects don't end the way they start and not only is it important to be able to adequately and sufficiently adapt respond and and pivot to ensure that you're able to achieve the outcomes within the constraints of the project but as you go documenting those updates step by step is really important if you don't track that then all you know is that the plan wasn't followed that changes were made and we got across the finish line and that that's better than not getting across the finish line but it really doesn't give you the opportunity to understand why the changes were necessary where were we incorrect in our plan and what changes and how many changes we make those are all those those kinds of lesson learned or assumption that we cannot use in a future project and things like that so the first two here work performance reports exactly what it sounds like so typically status reports or progress reports these are very commonly used to report upstream up to stakeholders with the sponsor but i it's very important that you share those with the team i think that successes want a key criterion for successes to understand how you're being measured so whenever i provide those kinds of summaries or status reports to to my manager or to executives i always make sure that i've also shared it with my with the project team so that they understand what is being communicated and they understand how they're being perceived and also as part of that how they're being measured in terms of change requests we've already gone over this just wanna reiterate that there's sort of three key kind of change requests we we'd see here corrective action preventive action and d defect repair and once again i'll just emphasize how important it is to understand that change requests aren't only but waiting for something to break and then fixing it or waiting for something to be a problem and then fixing it but anticipating them seeing a likely problem and making a change to prevent that problem from occurring and that is monitor and control project work
Unit 3.1 - Topic 7 - Perform Integration Change Control.webm: next we'll take a look at the perform integration change control so i'm gonna spend a a little bit of extra time on this introduction because i i the name of this perhaps doesn't make intuitive sense so i wanna make sure that we're all have a good level set and have a shared understanding of this so this the formal definition of this is the process of reviewing all change requests approving and managing changes to deliverables op product documents the plan and communicating the decision so a couple of things here i wanna be clear that we've talked about change management or change control in a number of other places but it is useful that it's broken out as to its own process that often you know very large project and we'll talk about some of these stakeholders or groups involved every change request might spin off a process to its own group that needs to to manage it the other thing i wanna be really clear on is how important the last part of this definition is not only is this part of project integration focused on identifying and managing the changes and the identification and approvals and the all those kinds of things but that this last part communicating communicating the decision the change that is not communicated is is far worse for the project than not doing the change typically the communication part is essential so a big part of what this is this whole process is about is ensuring that documented changes within the project are are considered in an integrated manner so another way we would say it in a collaborative way or that the entire team on perhaps the organization are aligned on those changes while addressing overall project risk so as a project is going there's some kind of challenge some kind of a blocker and we need to resolve that well having this kind of process instead of firing from your hip or saying well let's just do this ensures that you are considering the implications of that change because the change could be as bad or worse in the initial situation depending on the remediation plan or for depending on the resolution that's proposed but not only that it's so important that that communication part is followed through so while the changes might start off as a conversation it's so important that these changes get recorded in a written form and get entered into the change management or configuration management system these kinds of change requests probably will impact things like the schedule or cost so it's very important to be thinking through those dimensions of the change as well and it's important that we're feeding these things back into project baseline lines so that we can reflect on that and always be learning from it and here's the other important part on why we need an entire process for this is that each documented change needs to have an approval process where that change is approved deferred or rejected by the responsible individual that's typically the project sponsor for the project manager but it could be a partner outside of the company if there's a vendor involved it could be the director of it if it's dealing with an it system or something like that so lots of options but what's critical here is that these changes need to be documented and there must be an audit trail of who approved and in wine and what the remediation strategy is so we're probably probably quite familiar with this format right now with the the flow chart of the inputs tools of techniques and outputs not surprisingly this is a bit one of the more complicated flow charts once again just a reminder to think of this as a list of options not as a list of requirements so let's take a look at the performance integration control change control inputs i don't think we see anything new here this is all things we've seen before so i think we're quite familiar with the kinds of inputs that we're seeing here in terms of the plan the relevant component here would be change management plan the config management plan scope baseline schedule based cost baseline so what were our expectations and what we're our what was the scope overall but also what is the plan for making changes in terms of environmental factors you know change governance policy and process is quite important and then for op the change control procedures are critical to make sure that you're following the right processes and procedures to initiate and follow through on those changes so in terms of the tools and techniques you know once again this is mostly things that we've seen before in terms of the expert judgment the kind of expertise you're looking for is once again technical knowledge of the industry this is pretty standard but also the legislation and regulations legal and procurement configuration management itself and risk management in terms of change control tools this is new this is this is the one new thing on this list these are tools that i identify document and decide they don't decide but identify doc and document the issue the potential change and the decision on that change and then track each candidate changed through that process so they're are discover and and documented i wanna pause for a second to talk about excel i'd be very i'd i urge a lot of caution using excel as a tool it's a very powerful tool or a google spreadsheet or ever kind of spreadsheet tool you prefer and you know i used to say that it excel not a tool it's a form of sabotage but because of the challenge of collaborating with it change control tools all of the tools that we talk about have to be collaborative and i wanna be clear that you know before cloud was so prevalent that was a that was very hard problem that was partially solved by shared drives or network drives but not necessarily very well today with cloud based files and virgin control i'd say that it would be acceptable as a tool but barely i really encourage you to identify other change control tools like servicenow or something like that to manage those kinds of things because the these are complex systems that have a a a lot of requirements and relatively sophisticated features can deliver huge value things like reporting and search and things like that in terms of data analysis we're looking to at alternatives and cost benefit same kind of decision making as as we saw on the last topic but in terms of meetings this this is also a little bit different than the other segments of pro project integration that we looked at and i really wanna talk about that change control board so the key meeting in this for for this part of the integration is that change control board they're often referred to as cc or cab a cab change advisory board it's a pretty standard form of of governance i want you to be expect and be ready to have to prepare a presentation or a rationale a business case for a change for a change control board certainly your you rarely see these in smaller organizations it'd be quite a large organization that would need the requirement or or or justify the expense investment in these kinds of groups they're exactly what they sound like so it's a group responsible for reviewing change requests they're gonna assess the potential changes review alternatives make a decision on whether or not to move forward with it and then communicate that decision to the change request so most changes are gonna have some kind of impact on time cost resource or risks and sometimes they can have quite large impact beyond the project that's one of the reasons that these organizations where cc exist also they help provide some governance and integration across different projects they see the same problem coming up several times or they see one projects seeking to make a change that would negatively impact another project then they can put the brakes on that and find an alternative so that both projects can be successful sometimes they also review configuration management management activities and we're gonna talk more about change advisory reports later but just i want you to be really clear that these things exist and that this is the primary meeting for this part of project integration and that a it is definitely a piece of bureaucracy but overall in a large organization they're they're also necessary and can deliver quite high value so let's talk about the outputs for integration perform integration control approve change requests project plan updates project document updates no surprise to see updates being the majority of this now in terms of approved change requests not much of a surprise there either but that's a a key output is gonna be what was changed and then how do you how do you document and how do you communicate that and that was perform integration change in control
Unit 3.1 - Topic 8 - Closing Project or Phase.webm: next we'll take a look at close project or phase so this is just the process of finalizing all activities of the project although sometimes in a large project we would use these the same process or the same integration for the end of a phase or a contract if that was part of the project the key benefits of this process is that the project and phase information is archived we know that the planned work is completed although part of this is making sure that when we say that the project phase is completed actually is and we'll we'll check that against the plan but also this is the time you're able to release teams or or personnel to say okay you're done here you can go on to under the next project so this process is always done or should always be done at the end of the project but could also be done at different milestones or the and the phases in the project itself here we have the inputs tools and techniques and outputs a very long list here once again just reiterating that these are options not requirements so you make sure that you choose the right set of tools inputs tools and outputs for you one of the more complicated workflow charts here as well in the pin box they they list a a large number of closing actions and activities this is almost all of them i i did choose one or two that didn't really fit around contracting because i've i wanted to get to fit on the slide i'm not gonna read all of these they're not surprising they're kinds of things that you would deal with at the end of a project from reassign personnel to dealing with excess materials the measuring stakeholder satisfaction they all make a lot of sense this is a very good list though it's and this is a very rigorous thorough list so i'm surely not criticizing it but also don't feel that you have to do all of these things so what are the inputs for closing a phase or a project well it's kind of everything the it's a long list here definitely not much new i think we've seen all of this except accepted deliverables and that is we already talked about what deliverable is but this is an accepted deliverable means that the sponsor or the stakeholder group the steering committee whoever the authority has been identified in the project charter as being able to say the success criteria of the project has been met then they would accept the deliverable whether it's product or a service or an organizational change whatever in terms of the plan the relevant components here are making sure that you're taking a look at what the the exit requirements exit criteria are you're last the only other thing to talk about here is procurement documentation it's important that all the finances of the project are taken care of as you wrap it up the other reason you say this see this integration happening the end of the phase is that it might make a lot of sense from a financial point of you to make sure that certain costs are wound down that invoices are paid and that there's a clean slate before moving on to the next phase one part of that is to make sure that the actual cost versus the estimated cost that you're able to identify next or calculate the exact actual cost because sometimes the actual cost will impact the rest of the project especially if it if there's a cost over you do an over budget sometimes that means if you to deduct that money from the remaining budget because there's just no more money so an important thing to keep in mind there in terms of the tools and techniques this is pretty straightforward expert judgment data analysis and meetings the expertise we're looking for here is around management control auditing any legal per humor things but also legislation regulations we wanna make sure that we're always following the rules coloring inside the lines and and meeting our requirements and and humor expectations in terms of data analysis there's gonna be dodge analysis because as we can see there's so many documents that's the primary way you're gonna analyze the the phase to ensure that things are done but we also see trend analysis and variance analysis but we also see regression analysis here this is the first time this has come up in the project initiation part of of the pin box and this is a technique that analyzes the inter relationships between different project variables that contributed to the project outcomes to try to understand where particular problems comma root cause analysis but also very much how to improve performance for future projects lastly we have meetings so this is just to confirm that deliverables have been accepted validate the exit criteria formal the completion of contracts evaluate the satisfaction of stakeholders do the lessons learned so if you're familiar with agile software this would very be very much the the retrospective part of it but also we've talked about how important it is to do knowledge and information transfer as well as lesson learned and all those kinds of things so that the organization has a good record of what happened and with the rationale especially around the changes but in addition to that has that the whole body of work is able to be reused so that the lessons and the and the mistakes can hopefully be appropriately applied to future projects and i really like that the pin box talks about celebrating success i think it's really important you know at the end of the big project i i i have many times put together a small party with a bit of catering some cake maybe some music and really make sure that we're having some fun and celebrating it's the great work though we did together because finishing big projects are are can be a major accomplishment we wanna recognize that and make sure people feel excited and validated it for their participation and work it now i do wanna take a moment to talk about the difference between success and failure i mean we've talked a lot in the in around charters and project plans and exit criteria so it's very important to understand what a successful project looks like and i don't mean that in terms of all projects every project will be different and when we measure that it's really important that we're honest and authentic it it's very easy to feel pressured to say something successful even if it isn't quite successful or maybe it's a miserable failure but for whatever reason it doesn't feel safe it or acceptable to say that something failed and that that's tough i i certainly encourage you to use your own professional judgment there i hope that you're in a place that can hear that and i always strive to embrace failure as a learning opportunity it's also really important that soon as there's a challenge or some kind of risk to a project that you're communicating it early and often and then clearly you certainly don't when i say embrace failures a learning opportunity i don't mean that i let a project run for ninety days or a hundred and eighty days and it's a miserable failure and we've lost millions of dollars and people have quit i that's not the kind of failure that i wanna embrace but know in the first thirty days week we saw a c significant mis on the budget you don't have enough money with the right people then let's stop that's saying there's a kind of failure our our plan failed to to accurately describe our requirements and and adapt and do better i also really like this quote from bill gates you know it's fine to celebrate success but it's more important to heed the lessons of failure that's a nice way to kind of put a bow on on what i was talking about there alright so let's take a look at the closed project for face outputs we're gonna have the project the updates to the project documentation we're gonna have the final product service or result transition the thing that we're actually shipping and then there needs to be in an a final report that's submitted that that this is very important because it provides a short summary of the entire project that means if there's are any questions about what happened why things happened or how they happened that it this is the right document to share but also this is a a very useful learning tool so that people don't have other people project managers other people stakeholders in the organization don't have to read all of the project documentation which what we seen can be quite extensive lastly of course as we and a project if there's lessons learned if we have new insights about our operational our organizational processes then we can update those as well so i did talk about that final report quite a bit already i'm not gonna go through each of these points but the i i i will say that the you'll see this is very focused on a summary and covers off a lot of different things in particular the overall summary of the project the summary of the final product and the summary of risks and any issues encountered during the project these are some of the the key things so why this is important is not only because we're looking at how to successfully the wrap up or close the project or phase but if you understand the final report if you know what you need to report on which is a little bit like seeing if you know how you're gonna be measured at the beginning of your project and it's gonna give you the insight and the ability to to efficiently and easily plan what you need a document to get there what you don't wanna do speaking from experience is finish your project and say okay now i need to need need to write a report and have to go through all the documentation as you go to discover all those things especially if it's been a a long project running for many months so what i would encourage you to do is think about that final report before you get started and from there you could even start to rough it in with some bullet points and some key dates and and a comments as you go to give yourself a head start when you have to write your if i don't report lastly we have some questions i did not update the slide this is not unit two twenty three this is unit three point one but despite that i still welcome your questions and look forward to your feedback on this material and hopefully we can get have some discussion either on e econ or on ms teams and that is closed project or phase and that wraps up unit three point one
Unit 3.2 - Topic 1 - Scope Management.webm: hello and welcome to unit three point two managing scope schedule and cost so before we get started i just wanna take a look at the triple constraint this is exactly what this entire unit is about how do we manage scope schedule and cost of course time and schedule are interchangeable here so this entire unit is all about the dr constraint it's important that i acknowledge that the pm box does not use his term and is not on the pm p exam not in terms of the not regarding the term the triple constraint however in my experience this is a very common way to discuss project management and planning and i wanna reinforce this idea before we look at the specific practices around each of these constraints okay so let's take a a take a look at the first topic here scope management okay so what is project scope management alright well the technical definition as presented in the pm box is that it's the processes required to ensure the project includes all the work and only the work that's a very important distinction to complete the project successfully this about defining you controlling what is and what is not included in the project so scope is exactly what about that know what is going to be included and what is not being included being clear and explicit and having a shared understanding of what not is of what is not being included is you just as important to project success as defining what is so we have a a set of processes that are involved with scope with a scope management you have you can see the list here i did use a process chart here because these are a part of a process but i want to make sure that we're keeping in mind that we could iterate on this this isn't sort of a one and done situation this does follow this sequence but it does not mean that it's the only sequence in that it doesn't mean you won't have to go back and update things as well i wanna pay particular attention to the create w s this is the work breakdown structure and it's the process of sub dividing project deliverables and project working into smaller more manageable components and probably the most important thing which actually they don't say in the definition the pm box the most important thing about that work breakdown structure is the ability to sequence schedule estimate cost but this is the big one assign the task the work breakdown structure is all about having work be presented or defined and small enough pieces to actually hand off to a person or a team have them work on and successfully complete it so we're gonna see pretty similar and template or structure as we saw in the previous unit in terms of an overall outline a flow chart inputs tools and techniques and outputs when to see that same process here and i'll follow a similar kind of engagement where i'm not gonna go super deep on things that you can read on your own i'm gonna make sure that i'm identifying the most important things and unpacking them and helping connect the dots between the the topics and the information so what are the key concepts of scope management we'll definitely product scope that's the features and functions of the product service or result so what what is the scope of the deliverables but then we also have project scope and this is all the work performed to to deliver that product service or result sometimes project scope includes product scope i i think that's not the best solution i mean it's a very small project certainly and of course tailoring is everything so you know you need to make the that own decision for yourself in my experience having clear product scope and project scope be separately identified is quite useful especially in software we're or it where i've spent most of my project time now to be clear the completion of scope is gonna be measured against the project management plan whereas the product scope is gonna be measured against the product requirements okay and just to be super clear requirements are the the condition or capability that's needed in in the product or service or result to be measured as successful or to status by the agreement or whatever the specification was and this is the reason why i like to separate these things because by when things are measured differently then i think we need to to manage them differently otherwise you it can things can get confusing and misaligned to two more big things in terms of key concepts for scope management and that's are we using a predictive life cycle or remember that's that upfront two planning phase gate approach waterfall style so are you gonna to find all your diff the deliverables at the beginning and changes to the scope or progressively manage or are we gonna look at that adaptive life cycle so you know this is that agile software development is a very common place to see this and here the the deliverables are developed over multiple iterations and so detailed scope is defined and approved add iteration as opposed to upfront at the beginning i'm not gonna go into the reasons why there might be benefits for that that's a whole other topic but i will say that what's very important really for both there making sure you're continuously engaged with sponsors and customer representatives the stakeholders stakeholder management and engagement is critical to success either way i will say that you're gonna need a lot more of it in the adaptive or agile life cycle you need to keep checking in with them basically at the end of every iteration to review the results and get guidance on your plan for the next steps but so for each of these three topics we're looking at we'll look at a tailoring slide on tailoring considerations i don't think this i don't think these are gonna be super surprising and i i don't need to go through them all i will say i i will i do wanna make sure that i sort of address something that's particularly important on each of them i will say development approach is very important are you gonna use if it's software it are you using an agile development approach or is iterative incremental predictive some sort of hybrid understanding that it's gonna be absolutely critical to to project success it large part because over the last ten twenty years we've seen so much new diversity and innovation and how to in the different life cycles that are used in commonly in project management so something very important i will also talk about stability requirements you know if we don't have requirements upfront that can be totally fine if the project life lifecycle is designed for that but we need to be we need to understand what that means in terms of setting expectations for outcomes yeah in fact if an another thing to consider is if you know for sure that we don't we cannot well understand requirements early in in the project there'll will be a strong indicator that an adapt over agile format our project life cycle would be more appropriate so let's talk a little bit about agile and at adaptive environments this is a an important theme through all of these three topics so for scope management with projects with evolving requirements like we were just talking about or their high risk or there's lots of uncertainty like we've never done this before when we can't know the scope early then that indicates a a likely match or good alignment with agile or adaptive project a life cycles in and overall organizational or enterprise environments so agile methods you know are designed to spend less time on defining and agreeing on scope and more on shipping things at the early stages of the of of the pro of the process and see those early iterations as part of the ongoing discovery and refinement you know i've said this before i'll say again planning is guessing change management is all about identifying the best possible way to be most successful with predicting the future and predicting the future is very hard in my experience that these agile and adaptive practices can be very helpful in shortening the feedback cycles so that you're be better able to adapt to what you discover at once you put shovel in the ground once you've actually started doing the work if you're familiar with home renovation shows there's always this moment where they pull back a wall and there's such s this is so different than what we thought it's a little bit of a cliche on the home renovation shows but i think a pretty common experience in most projects that you know until you actually start pulling down the wall or start doing the the real work you cannot fully discover the scope of what is necessary in being able to adapt to that is is very important so agile methods you know are designed to have and review prototypes release versions in order to refine the requirements by validating the work with real customers therefore that means the scope is defined and redefined throughout the project in the requirements are not a large requirement doc document that's exhaustive but rather it's a backlog of features that can be adapted and updated as we learn as we go alright so let's take a look pat the process chart for plan scope management this is pretty straightforward and once again we have one of these large sprawling flow charts how and once again i'll remind you that this is not a list of requirements for this practice but a list of options and opportunities for you to tailor to your own projects so let's now take a look at scope management inputs you i'm intentionally going a bit faster with inputs tools and techniques and outputs we've very clearly established this pattern and how we how the information in the pm box is presented so i'm i'm shifting to more highlights because this has a lot of repetition now when i i my expectations that you're quite familiar with this format if that's not the case please make sure that you let me know and i'll be asking about this in our class meeting this coming this coming week okay so project charter we're very familiar with of course scope management would require that the plan is critical to this as well not all of it the key things are the quality management plan how do we know that the not only are we so the project charter the validation the sign off on that is all to ensure that we're building the right thing quality management is gonna be concerned with are we building the thing right we're also looking at of the project life cycle description in the project management plan and the development approach and we've already talked about those options predictive waterfall adaptive at agile hybrid but this is the place to document that now what might be the case that this is very well under stood in your organization and that's where that ee enterprise environmental factor comes into play so you know organizational culture infrastructure personnel marketplace conditions very much come into play here and for op ups policies and procedures particularly around project life cycle or development approaches would be relevant here as well as historical information and lessons learned so next let's take a look at the tools and techniques very similar very familiar things that we're seeing here in terms of expert judgment we're particularly looking for expertise in previous similar projects and industry expertise for data analysis we're primarily looking at alternatives analysis from my perspective this is not a strong case for data analysis i i don't think in scope management we're gonna be doing a ton of the analysis i think it's more strategic analysis and i think that expert judgment in previous similar projects or in the industry experience is gonna be quite a bit more important here the and then lastly meetings we're we're not gonna able to run a project and manage collaboration and alignment and communication without meetings so project meetings but particularly team input to develop scope to develop the scope of management plan is critical you really can't skip that step you wanna make sure the team is part of that conversation for two key reasons the first is that they have valuable subject magic matter x expertise that you wanna make sure is included as early as possible so that the the plan can account for it but the second thing is and this is equally important you wanna make sure that you get buy in that they're supportive and they're excited they're engaged with the project and that's give me a lot harder if you simply hand someone a plan and tell them they have no saying in it and just do the work so by engaging people in the scope management plan development you can help have a better plan by having greater diversity of opinion and invoices and expertise at the table but also hopefully have the more support throughout the team for the project itself so what are the outputs of scope management well the scope management plan and or the requirement management plan so in terms of the pro the scope management plan you know this is gonna be you know how are you gonna but what is the process for preparing the project scope statement what is the process for the work breakdown structure how do we establish the scope baseline will be approved and maintained and how do we know that what the how the completed project deliverables will be measured and accepted now this is very important scope management plan can be formal or informal broadly framed or highly detailed based on the needs of the project so how would you know which one of those options to go with well like it's a smaller project with fewer people it's less critical to the organization and the budget is smaller then it's probably not worth the investment the effort for a formal highly detailed plan if it is big strategic the future of the organization depends on it if it's a huge if it's a measurable part of or significant part of the annual budget yeah then it's gonna be worth it for us for this to be formal and highly detailed and things like that so let's also take a make sure that we're thinking about what a requirements management plan looks like this is gonna describe how the project and product requirements will be analyzed documented and manage there's lots of additional information on this in the world of business analysis and that's referenced in the pm box so in fact it might be called the business analysis plan in some organizations what would be in this kind of document well how requirement activities will be planned tracked and reported the configuration management plan and in process so how will changes be initiated how impact be analyzed and what are what's the authorization levels for each of those things to to approve changes also how do we prioritize requirements what are the measurements they'll be used and what and why are we using those and what's the trace process how do we know who made what change when and who also proposed or submitted which requirement as you go through the project when there's necessary need to change part of the requirements you need to be able to go back to the people who were participated in articulating and defining that requirement to back check that the the new direction the adaptation the update is still gonna meet the same need that's critical and that is scope management
Unit 3.2 - Topic 2 - Schedule Managment.webm: next we'll take a look at schedule management so the pm box defines project schedule management as the process required to manage the timely completion of the project that one's pretty straightforward this is about making sure that all the work will be done on time or identifying that there isn't enough time or too much work or something like that so here are the processes identified by the pm ba around project schedule management once again i've indicated or sorry of use this as a process diagram a reminder that it doesn't have to be in this exact sequence and that there could be rework or updates applied to that taking a look at this this is pretty straightforward i don't know think there's a lot of things that are surprising or need unpacking here i will talk about that last option control schedule this is defined as the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and manage changes to the schedule baseline this is a very important step and i pointed out because if you're not spending the time and energy to control the schedule that is to monitor and make adjustments then it's almost the same as not having the plan so very important and please don't overlook that here's the overview diagram for schedule control and let's take a look at the key concepts as you can see no flow chart so the this is very straightforward i i don't think we need a lot of help understanding this the key concepts here the project how and when so what is how is the work to be performed and when does it need to be done by and then what kind of scheduling model are you going to take this has something to do with whether you're looking at predictive or adaptive but also is it quarterly is it weekly what are the phases things like that let's take a quick closer look at this diagram which is in the pm box it pulls together things like the scheduling method scheduling tools scheduling model and project information and it generates that project schedule here we see some options like gan charts or critical paths so activity list bar chart network diagram sorry other things we could see as product schedule will be a gan chart which was it's actually a kind of bar chart really lots of options there important to understand which ones to choose and why and what fits your project the best so the tailoring considerations here are pretty straight four what is what are what's the life cycle approach you're taking what are the resources available project dimensions so how complex is there how much of this is new what's the urgency and things like that and then technology support how do we develop record and manage all parts of the project schedule and make sure that that it's accessible to the team once again just to talk about how important is to not only think about how to tailor this but make sure that there is enough time and enough resources to achieve the outcomes of the project there is a risk at this point we're we're actually in all points of scope schedule and cost of saying we're we need to do too much the we need to take closer look at this particular constraint and how it affects the success of the project it's in terms of agile or adaptive environments that adaptive model takes iterations so these are shorter cycles to do the work and review the results and then allow you to adapt the work sooner that's that's the key thing here so in terms of scheduling this is very important these cycles provide rapid feedback or value you to shorten the feedback loop which that's one of the key outcomes that we look for when we're employing agile methods it also means that you're having iterative scheduling an on demand pull based scheduling so if you're familiar with agile software development what they're talking about is that you scheduled by sprint and that you pull work from the backlog that would be the the language of agile software development used to describe the exact same thing it's important to note that whether you're using predictive or adaptive project life cycle models this doesn't change your role as the project managers it's very important that you change how you are managing the project to to match or be aligned with that project cycle but the the role and the responsibilities don't change here we have the process chart for plan schedule oh sorry we do have a flow chart here very simple one though very very simple let's take a look at the inputs here we have the project charter of course project management plans so this is in fact the exact same inputs as we saw previously on scope however important difference is that while it's the same four inputs what's important or relevant in each of them is slightly different so for the project management plan scope management plan and development approach are the key things that we need to make sure that we're using as an input from the ee f you know organizational culture team resource availability that that's actually very important so it's absolutely critical to understand who you're what resources are needed from your organization and i i would prefer to say people i don't really like referring to people as resources so who is able to do the work and when is they're available where they located we have a a lot of remote work what time zone are they in these are all important factors so coordinating this is extremely important because as your schedule changes throughout throughout over the course of your project the timing of when somebody's needed could be earlier or later or exactly on track but also their other work will also be fluctuating or there'd be drift or deviation from their plans as well so very important there's a lot of coordination here and if you are in an organization with that project manage an office or portfolio program management office this is a great time to work with them because their job typically is to have that higher level strategic view of all of the projects and the different people who are needed for them and help coordinate that if you don't have a pm o then a sponsor of the project might be somebody you could go through this same sort of thing so the other the last factor what scheduling software does the organization order to use that could be something like microsoft outlook or google calendar lots of other options as well for organizational process assets what we see here is the need to bring in some historical information but also formal and informal schedule development so what are the templates or the processes something that's really important here is that scheduled development and i really like that the pin box the pm box takes a look at informal here because it in my experience often there's a high influence owner who owns a particular resource for service maybe it's an an executive assistant who books time with a particular sponsor or a stakeholder and there may actually be no proper former channel or the formal channel may exists such as an invite through a a calendar but if you don't go through that person that informal of the that informal sorry owner of that schedule or resource or whatever then maybe doesn't actually ever get seen or acknowledged so very important to understand on the ground how things actually get scheduled and proceed accordingly so let's take a look at the tools and techniques again we see very similar pattern here as to the last topic in terms of the expert judgment we're looking for scheduled development management and control that goes hand in hand with with what i just said about those informal systems of scheduling so those would be the experts that you wanna bring into this kind of conversation what are the methodologies for scheduling predictive or adaptive what kind of software you use and then anything that's you know specific around the industry but that's pretty standard i think we can understand that for any time we're bringing in expert judgment these times so in terms of data analysis and meetings it's pretty straightforward once again not a lot of data analysis happening here potentially looking at scheduling conflicts would be very important but we can also look at major events as there is your annual user conference happening or are people away for a vacation because it's summer or a particular holiday all those kinds of things so definitely something to think about and the meetings are really just the necessary work to collaborate and come up with a schedule in terms of outputs we have a a single output here it's the schedule management plan which is part of that larger project management plan so what does what would be in the schedule management plan well here we'll see things like the schedule model how we the methodology and the tool to be used what are we gonna how do we when do we release and what are iterations so this is really more of an adaptive life cycle piece so what's the time box for sprints or iterations when do we have releases or waves one of the key things around adaptive practices or agile practices is a time boxing does a really effective excuse me a job of minimizing scope creep because it puts a very strong time constraint but not always i've i've seen it happen there too what level of accuracy and how do we measure don't wanna go too much into this but it is important that we talk about is this a weekly monthly quarterly kinda schedule and are or and how are we be measuring or of the the schedule and things like that and then lastly we wanna make sure that we're talking about control thresholds so you know how do we monitor the schedule what what is the trigger or what is the the criteria for when we have to intervene and what when what does that look like this is often something like a percentage deviation from from the baseline established metrics so we can take a a a look at that more of there's practice there's other practice documents on scheduling that you can take a look at they're they're linked and that that wraps up schedule management
Unit 3.2 - Topic 3 - Cost Management.webm: next we'll take a look at cost management so the pm box defines cost management as the process involved in planning estimating budgeting financing funding managing controlling costs so the project can be completed within the approved budget estimating so you know cost management planning is all of those things but simply put how do you how do you budget or allocate the resource of the money for a project how do you know how much you've spent and how do you make sure that you don't overs spend you know cost management planning should happen quite early in project planning and can often be very influential for the rest of the project because much can be spent is a very strong constraint also it's very hard to go back in time and implement any kind of financial control so the cost management processes and the and the tools that you'd use for that they're all good they need to be documented in the cost management plan which is a component of the project management plan so we see the same kind of pattern with how the information's is being presented as the previous two topics so we can first take a look at the four processes again this is a it is a sequence but it doesn't have to be in this order or at all i i think all relatively straightforward once again i'm gonna focus on the control costs in the same way we talked about control schedule because if if if you have all the time spent on the planning but don't have a monitor and control part of the process then it's about the same as if you don't have a plan again we have the overview of these processes what are the key concepts here well lifetime cost is a is a key one they don't use that language i'll be very clear that you know i try really hard to use the exact same language as you see in the pm box but they actually don't quite get to the point when talking about the key concepts around cost management at least not in the way i would so i would say lifetime cost is very important what what they talk about is how it's very important the cost management be focused beyond sort of the particulars the product and the project but also on subsequent recurring costs of you know using and maintaining or supporting that product if you're you're if you're gonna buy a library or license software or license intellectual property then you need to understand the ongoing cost and sometimes those costs aren't flat they could raise over time maybe they'll drop over time and that'd be great but typically you you're going to see those kinds of things increasing costs over time but the example they use in the in the pm box which is actually a really good example is that you could choose to limit the number of design reviews for a particular product and that would absolutely save time it would save money as as well but it could increase the overall cost of running the product because the the decrease in design likely will result in a in a design that isn't as good certainly there's a upper limit where you're gonna get diminishing returns so we don't need a hundred design reviews but if you say we're gonna do one design review then all you're doing is shifting project cost into lifetime cost as you get more support complaints or more issues because of not not investing enough in design the other important thing is cost determination again my phrase not theirs because they don't really give this a name but i think it's a very important point i really appreciate that they have this content and what we mean by cost determination is that no not every part of your organization is going to determine cost the same way especially when you look at stakeholders so the cost of an acquired item might be measured when the acquisition and decision is made or it could happen once delivered or when it's actually billed those kinds of things so it's very important to make sure that you understand that difference and make sure that you're working with clear expectations for all stakeholders and probably choose one method but you might translate that into some other methods elsewhere what do we need for tailoring considerations here pretty straightforward knowledge management estimating and budgeting let me talk a little bit about earned value management so this is a very particular kind of calculation in the pm box it links off to some additional information we're not gonna spend much time here i i wanna be clear not gonna spend much time on earned value management in this course definitely something that's worthwhile looking at and i encourage you to but there won't be there won't be anything about earned value man in the evaluation of this course use of agile in governance governance is particularly important here i'm sorry governance is particularly important here because most organizations while they might not have much governance around change management or things like that almost all organizations need very strong governance around how money is spent so who has signing authority who can issue an invoice what are the audit practices all those kinds of things there could be you know a procurement department who can who is required to authorize vendors for purchases all those kinds of things so very important to understand the governance dimension of of your project in taylor accordingly so let's talk about cost managing cost within agile in adaptive environment so when there's a high degree uncertainty it's very difficult to calculate like the cost this is actually one of the benefits of agile that might sound counter but if you have a very clear number an estimate down to the penny in my experience that that's gonna be wrong because it's very hard to predict the future and you're giving a false sense of certainty when you are able to say it's gonna cost between twenty thirty thousand dollars is our estimate on the low end this is you know you know four sprints on the upper end it looks more like six sprints if we choose to go more sprints as we continue to discover the problem then there'll will be an according increase in cost so you know lightweight estimation methods can be used for within agile for a fast high level forecast but then they get adjusted with each with each iteration we need to adjust those so budgeting is extremely important here to put a a cap on how much the project can spend that'll be very important in being able to manage and plan how to allocate resources and how what how to prioritize the work went when there's a high variability project and it's subject to a strict budget then scope and schedule or more often just to stay within cost constraints so this is a really great point it's one of the very few places in the pm block we hear them talk about the triple constraint right so if cost is very very constrained then the then you need to leave that alone and look at the other two freedoms the the other two constraints scope and schedule to free that up so if you can only spend a hundred thousand dollars and you have to say it'll take a long time because we're gonna do it part time when teams have availability or we're gonna do less because we can only afford this much and that's really how the whole triple constraint is always intended to be thought of that you know it's an you're never gonna be able to to constrain the the scope the schedule and the cost that's a a very likely way for the project to fail now when you say that there are two degrees of freedom that's pretty great often there'll be one degree of freedom right that degree freedom often in scope is schedule and cost typically are the kinds of things that that organizations seek to put constraints onto what's available that time as well given this schedule and this cost here is what we could do we could do you know ten tasks and you have to make sure that you're normalizing or or those tasks are of approximately equal size and that's a very difficult thing to do so this is a very abstract example i'm giving but you know here's ten things we could do but we a list of twenty which half of this do you wanna get done given the time and money that we have for this project like the other topics we have the process flow and we also have the flow chart very simple in this case again so let's take a look at those cost management inputs no change here so what's important about the project management plan well this is about schedule management and risk management that's what we need to be bringing in so that we can understand how how to manage costs in terms of the enterprise environmental factors organizational culture as usual market conditions are quite important here understanding how much you're gonna to be able to charge either as a retail product or as a as a charge service billable service very important i'm really happy that the pm box talks about currency exchange rates this can be extremely important and as canadians i think we're pretty familiar with the the kind of you know often thirty percent conversion rate that we have to us currency if you don't understand or or make a mistake with what the currency exchange rate is that can have a very significant impact on your ability to be successful you know sometimes it'll that could work in your favor that rarely seems to but the other thing that's really important here is that for very long projects you know if you're measuring project phases or milestones and quarters not months then that's more than enough time for currency rates to change so if you have significant costs such as your outsourcing a particular team or you have a a ongoing license agreement with a vendor that has a variable rate or it'll be a renewal during that period than understanding and being able to anticipate those possible cost changes need to be part of your cost management plan in terms of organizational process assets then this is very important and relatively straightforward the financial control procedures of your organization need to be front and foremost who signs off on spending who can submit an invoice the those are extremely important also any procurement procedures are equally critical the pm box talks about financial databases and things like that sure i i i don't see anything wrong with that we also talk about formal and informal estimating and budget policies i i have a lot more interest in in you paying attention to that op in part because of the formal and informal dimension i'd be relatively we're cautious with informal estimating and budget policies unless it's a very small organization typically this is the kind of place because money is on the table that you want to have strong formally identified processes and procedures so let's take a look at the tools and techniques same three here so let's focus primarily on expert judgment previous similar projects modeling past costs for future costs are very effective information in the industry or disciplined application of course is necessary here bringing in someone who understands cost estimates and budgeting extremely important and once again they talk about earned value manager in my experience is not that important and i i don't think you need to spend much time on that alright so what is the output here we have a single key output the cost management plan again units of measurement we talked a little about a bit about that in the last topic units of measurements is kind a quite important here level of precision actually quite a bit more important here are you going to estimate to the penny to the dollar to the thousand dollar to the millions of dollars you need to find out and also what's the level of accuracy when you were looking at the cost estimate how much buffer is there or what is the flexibility of those are do once again you get to be to the penny or is within ten percent sufficient we also need to take a look at those control thresholds how do we identify when there's variance and what interventions if any are required so if a invoice comes back as unpaid what is the process if of of an invoice comes back greater than estimated or less than estimated how how do we manage that over how do we adjust the budget or or try to renegotiate if there's some kinds of saving or an inefficiency that wasn't expected is that gonna be plowed back into the existing project as buffer for some other place that has gone cost or does that immediately get pulled back out very important things understand before the project starts i'll also touch on that reporting formats quite important in this in this part of project management not only because there's typically very rigorous and uncompromising or inflexible requirements for the organization based on the accounting needs but also if you're a large organization especially if you're working in a publicly traded organization then there's going be audits by an external auditor so the reporting format around managing money is gonna be quite important and not negotiable so with that we we wrap up unit two point three point two rather so i'll look forward to your questions and you can share those either on discussions on eco econ or on our ms teams group
Unit 4 - Topic 1 - Project Quality Management.webm: hello and welcome to unit four achieving project success in this unit we'll be looking at a number of key topics in particular managing project quality project resources project risks and project communications when you complete this unit you will be able to describe the key elements of project success and present a project plan based on best practices there were four topics the four topics that i just listed as i go through i will also indicate some material that we will not be covering in these sections i'll also indicate or make sure you're aware of that there are entire sac actions that we're not covering once again we're not a certification course so i just wanna be clear that i i have selectively and strategically chosen the things that i think are most important for this short introduction to project management certainly each of these parts of the pe box could be an entire unit on their own so what we have here is a relatively high level overview of these topics to give you a solid introduction and some detailed information as well to help you achieve the outcomes of our course so let's take a look at the first of these topics and that's project quality management nope that's one thing i wanted to say there as we cover this material you're gonna continue to see the same patterns we've seen throughout the pin box of the process diagram inputs tools and techniques and outputs and i wanted to mention that i think this is quite helpful because it ensures that the material is easily comparable and i think of it as normalizing data in the database so what is project quality management well i won't read all of this quote but it includes processes for incorporating the organization's quality policy to meet stakeholder objectives and i think it's very important to note here that this is a continuous process that it's certainly not one and done this illustration provides a complete overview of the project quality management section of the pin box this provides the structure of the topics for this unit but please be very clear that we looking at the introduction to the entire section and eight point two manage quality we're not covering plan quality management or control quality management so what are the key concepts for quality management well clearly quality is the first of them this is one of the first times we've had a significant focus on quality and covering this material so how do we define quality well in the pe box they refer to the iso nine thousand which is the international standards organization they have a number of different occasions that organizations and facilities are able to achieve if they meet their requirements and the iso nine thousand specification defines quality as the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements so once again we have a very broad relatively which you know can apply to any industry but the key thing here is how well the characteristics of the product match the requirements so the second key concept here is that quality is universal the key the statement here in the pin box is that project quality management applies to all parts of our project and all projects this is not an optional part of a project and it's very important that you have some idea and some plan on how you're going to manage quality otherwise it will be impossible to succeed the next key concept is that deliverables define quality so this comes very this ties very tightly to what i was saying previously in the definition of quality but in terms of what quality is that's always gonna to be defined or dependent on what the deliverable is and that's part of the reason that iso nine thousand definition is so broad and so vague because they need to provide a definition that can use for any for any deliverable so how quality is measured is dependent on the deliverables of that project and the last one here is prevention over inspection so prevention is a very important idea here in this and what we wanna do is we wanna ensure that instead of finding defects or problems with quality and then mitigating or resolving those problems we would like to prevent them from happening in the first place this is quite simply because it's less expensive and there's less waste in the introduction they talk about the five levels of quality management so we'll review those here i think these are quite useful and they go from left to write in terms of sort of the lowest levels to the highest levels and this is when you if you're interested and why are they ranked in this way it has a lot to do with how expensive and how sustainable these quality practices are so taking a look at the first item here the first level customer discovered this is typically the most expensive approach of letting the customer find the defect this can lead to warranty issues recalls loss of reputation and rework costs so certainly a way to do quality management but suboptimal optimal to be sure the next is to detect and correct before delivery so this inspect those deliverables when before they're sent to the customer and the quality the quality control quality process has related costs which are about appraisal costs and internal failures so in the detecting correct incorrect before delivery we've still produced the deliverable before we have found the the defect or the quality issue so we move to quality assurance next in the middle and by using quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects so quality assurance is both about looking at the actual deliverables but also reflecting on the process that we use to produce the deliverables and ensuring that we correct any problems with that so for example if there was a missing die or missing part in an assembly line if there was a code check or a code check checkpoint that was not being followed those are the kinds of things that quality assurance would help us solve next we have quality planning which is from the very beginning from first principles to incorporate quality into the design and planning of the project and the product this is amongst the most efficient ways and most powerful ways to be able to manage and plan for quality and then lastly the gold standard is to create a culture of quality which means that throughout the organization everyone is aware of quality and committed to it in all of the processes and products quality so in terms of how we would tailor project management to address pro project quality there are four options here that recommended in the pm box the first is policy compliance in auditing so this asks what qualities that quality policies of procedures exist in the organization what quality tools techniques and templates are used in the organization so you want to first look at what is existing but also how could we augment or enrich those policies and procedures for how we measure and audit quality we need to look at standards and regulation compliance certainly in manufacturing there are many specific quality standards and we're starting to see those kinds of standards and regulations such as the gdpr the privacy legislation out the eu we're starting to see these kinds of standards and regulations come into software and it industries as well of course in terms of governmental or legal considerations that could also be something that's a local regulation not necessarily international accessibility could be part of that as mandated by the government but the other thing to consider is that legal considerations are here as well so thinking about any constraints in your contracts or agreements with your customers is very important next we look at continuous improvement which is engaging a process of always asking how can we do better so looking at how will quality improvement be managed in the project so this is this can happen at the organizational level or at the level of each project i would say ideally it should be happening at both and in the last piece of project quality tailoring is stakeholder engagement is there a collaborative environment for stakeholders and suppliers making sure that stakeholders have strong buy in or that you are aligned with stakeholder expectations and standards around quality is is very important and understanding how much of that you need in your project could make a significant difference in the outcome next we'll look at agile or adaptive environments and how quality intersect with them so it's very important to keep in mind that agile methods are typically have frequent quality and review steps built in throughout the project instead it at the end this is one of the key characteristics especially looking at something like scrum so we have a time box or a sprint time and definition of done in demos and retro are all part of the cadence of the sprint in terms of those agile rituals or ceremonies and a huge focus on that is on quality and review retrospective in particularly regularly check not only on the product but also asks how could we as a team work better and seeks to typically focus on a single change at a time so presents a hypothesis i believe our team would be more effective if and then tries it out for one or more sprints with a with a time box on that experiment as well to reflect on if we're gonna adopt that new work practice on an ongoing basis in order in order to facilitate frequent incremental delivery agile is designed to ship small batches of work or ship small sets of code so incorporating as many elements of project deliverables is very important this is often referred to as thin slicing making sure you have something that's usable with each release small batch systems aimed to uncover inconsistencies and quality issues earlier in their project life cycle because once again the costs of change are lower and that is the project quality management next we'll take a look at manage quality
Unit 4 - Topic 2 - Manage Quality.webm: next we'll take a look at manage quality manage quality is defined in the pin box as the process of translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities so simply put this is taking the plan for how to manage quality and making it real in terms of the project outcomes it's very important to think of and can and understand that managing quality is the work of everybody the project manager the project team the sponsor management of the performing organization even at times the customer this is important because it significantly increases the probability that quality objectives will be met and quality essential to success for two key reasons one by reducing waste and time but also by making sure that we have customer satisfaction those two things are key metrics for project success manage quality uses the data and results from the control quality process to reflect the overall quality status of the project to the stakeholders so put another way the key part one key task of managed qualities is to be able to report on the quality status to stakeholders manage quality is sometimes referred to as quality assurance but it's important to understand that manage quality actually has a broader definition than quality assurance as it is used in non project work quality assurance is about using project processing these effectively it involves following and meeting standards to assure stakeholders that their final product will meet their needs expectation requirements manage quality includes all of that but is also concerned with product designed aspects and process improvements so let's take a look at the process flow for manage quality we continue to see the inputs tools and techniques and outputs format and we also have the manage quality flow chart this one is relatively simple again don't stress over these flow charts and process diagrams are important resources for you and important and very useful as references but not particularly high priority for the content that i'm teaching so what are the manage quality inputs when we have three key things here in terms of the project management plan quality management the what we see in the project management plan is the quality management plan which defines the acceptable level of project and product quality as well as describing the means and plans on how to achieve that level of quality in both deliverables and processes the quality management plan also describes want to do with non conforming products and what corrective action to implement this is very important if you only understand when thing how to measure when things are not meeting call quality standards but you don't have a process on how to remediate or correct then you will never get to the point of actually achieving your quality goals in terms of project documents the relevant documents here would be lessons learned quality control measures quality metrics and the risk report in terms of organizational process assets key things to look for here are quality management systems any templates for measuring quality or auditing previous audits to set baseline lines and context and expectations as well as lessons learned something not mentioned in the pm box is a qa department whether it's manufacturing or technology often there will be a qa department that you could interact with perhaps delegate a quality work to or at least partner and collaborate with i'll observe that in the pay they don't have any enterprise environmental factors here i'm not entirely sure why so i'm happy to share my thoughts and what ee would look like here legal and industry quality regulations would be relevant certifications such as iso would be something that would be very important and particularly because that could drive requirements or can strengths on how processes are are structured and and executed additionally the organization's overall attitude towards culture you remember what we talk about how important or a culture of quality is so understanding what kind of posture your organization has towards quality is quite important it's quality of value that we live every day in our organization or is it a box to be checked with minimal effort and investment the reality is that wherever you work will probably be somewhere in between those but understanding this is very important to being able to manage the success of your project so not next let's talk about the manage quality tools and techniques here we have a number of things data gathering checklists are very common here particularly standardized checklists to track an auto quality work data analysis quite important in terms of alternatives and document and process analysis especially when looking for process improvements however the most important kind of data analysis to take a look at is root cause analysis anytime we identify a defect or a something that's not meeting our quality standards we need to be able to understand the root cause of it so that we can remediate or provide an alternative and fix that situation data representation is quite important here we often have complex forms of data and representations or visualizations charged diagrams can be a very effective way to communicate that especially shared throughout the organization and we'll take a closer look at that in the next slide decision making is of course critical when you look at any quality issue there must be a decision made as to how we will respond to it typically this is not the situation where we're gonna vote on things or that we'll have a single person make the decision more often than not the the best practice here is for a multi criteria decision analysis so scoring against a rubric or in the preexisting threshold for when it's time to take corrective action be very careful to not confuse project decisions with product decisions here one will be about the deliverable and the other is about the process and management of the project overall audits are important tool here the definition provided by pm box here is a structured independent process used to determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies processes and procedures another very technical definition auditing is simply double checking it's confirming results it's knowing it's about transparency and accountability it's what documentation do you have to be able to trace or track a defect or mistake some kind of out of bounds conduct or or implementation of the project so that we are able to fix it sometimes there's a a lot of concern in on a team about of blame being placed that typically that kind of culture will lead to people hiding things so i would really hope and encourage you to have the kind of culture and run a kind of team where mistakes are understandable and their support provided for how to correct them but transparency is is the key so that if we don't know where a problem is and we can't solve it looking at the next design for x this is a set of this is a design methodology that helps prioritize it a key feature or dimension of that product d x can control or or potentially even improve a product's final characteristics the key is defining what x is this could be things as reliability deployment manufacturing cost service many other things quality is definitely on that list quality is also quite broad based using the d the d for x auto design for x methodology may result in cost reductions quality improvement better performance in customer this faction in terms of software in particular i think that we often look at things like designing for security i would also incur an efficiency or performance but it's really important to get to really focus on that customer centric or user centric approach alright next is problem solving of course if once we identify a problem we must be able to solve it so that's an important tool there finding the root cause having a sorry first having a good being able to have a clear crisp definition the problem identifying root causes looking at possible solutions then choosing the best solution lastly we have quality improvement methods so these are things like plan do check act or six sigma those are two of the most common quality improvement tools but these are overall well known methodologies for how to identify and make recommendations for quality control processes next we'll take a look at data representations as i said we take a closer look at this the pm box takes a look at or identify six key data represent representations here we have affinity diagrams which can show help group defects into or help sorry help organize defects into groups rather so that you can identify or prioritize an area that needs to be focused on cause and effect diagrams also known as fish bone y y diagrams or diagrams this type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identify into discrete branches this can definitely accelerate and support identifying the main or root cause of the problem flow charts we've seen several examples of flow charts but that can help represent a process as a series of steps his grams show a graphical representation of numerical data this can be quite effective to represent things like number of defects per deliverable or ranking of the cause of defects please be clear that a his and a bar chart are not exactly the same thing matrix diagrams provide a strength of relations or demonstrates indicate the strength of relationships among different factors causes and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix lastly we have scattered diagrams which is a graph that shows the relationship to between two variables this can be particularly effective to show the relationship between an element such as a process and environment or activity and one access and quality defect on the other in terms of manage quality outputs we have quality reports this is a graphical numerical or qualitative this is particularly important to to share with the partners to take corrective action to achieve the project quality expectations next we have test and evaluation documents these are inputs to the control quality process and are used to evaluate the achievement of quality objects sorry quality objectives this could include things such as a checklist or a deep detailed requirements trace mat sees as part of a document now when we think about the kind of trace ability mat part of that is tying into the audit ability of of the work so we can identify at what point in a process the defect is occurring the we also have change requests of course once we identify a problem we'll will ideally be changing some part of our process to address that to prevent that problem from happening again so the manage quality process and needs to to be able to to bring forward those change requests to any other part of the the project plan or the organization and then lastly of course we have project management plan updates this would include include things such as quality management plan the scope baseline schedule baseline and cost baseline and that is manage quality
Unit 4 - Topic 3 - Project Resource Management.webm: next we will take a look at project resource management the pm box defines project resource management is the process to identify acquire and manage the resources needed for the successful completion of a project this would be a very good time to be clear on what they mean buying resources for the pm box resources refer to things like equipment and team members there's a distinction between the skills and competencies needed for the project manager to be able to manage the team resources versus the physical resources physical resources include things like equipment materials facilities infrastructure all those sorts of things team resources or personnel refer to the human resources personnel may have you know different skills be be part of the team on a full or part time basis and could be added or taken away from the project at different times depending on the needs of the project there certainly are some there's certainly overlap between project resource management and project stakeholder management in this section section nine i'm focused on the subset of stake stakeholders who make up the project team i'll also take a moment to say that i really dislike referring to people as resource is i think we should refer to people as people but for the purposes of this of this unit or this topic rather we'll use the language of the pm box which refers to resources as the things and people of a project so project resource management has quite a few things involved with it once again we will be taking a look at the introduction we will also take a deep dive on section one point nine point five managed team so to be clear we are not covering plan resources estimate resources acquire resources develop team or control resources all things that you could continue to look at if you so choose but for the purposes purposes of this course we're interested in the introduction of this section and section nine point five so let's take a look at the key concepts we have four key concepts here project leadership project management team development and team culture in morale high performing teams have a great culture what do i mean by great culture well i would define that as emotional safety independence and autonomy to design one's work and trust with strong alignment in along with shared values in a very strong shared working agreement and in terms of that idea of a working agreement will return to that when we look at team charters high performing projects are gonna be well designed monitored and controlled so investing in your team's capabilities and skills is essential to long term success there's something particularly important about the fact that they include team development in this and i really appreciate it the pm box in this section is talking about how important it is to continually invest and work on the development of team members and that means that we care about a team member about that person's ability and career their development outside of the immediate and direct needs of the of the deliverables of the project if we only care about the short term goal of a project and we don't provide stretch goals and support for growth and development then as an organization we won't see the trees for the forest we'll lose track of the the the bigger picture and we will not overall not be a successful organization so i really appreciate they take that time to define team development as part of a resource management i'd also be i also think it's important that we have some idea about what it means to be successful so of course we've talked about defining success in terms of the project charter and making that part of the project plan and knowing what your exit criteria are but what we're talking about here is what does it take for a person for a team member or even yourself to be successful well we know that there's three key things we need focus on the first is to be included valued if you don't feel like you're part of the team and don't feel that you're delivering value or offering value it's very hard to be successful you also know what you need to do and have the tools including the training and skills to do the job it's it's well understood in management that people don't really leave jobs but people leave managers that could potentially be a project manager typically not we're probably be talking more about an authority or a direct report management position but you know managers including project managers one of your primary responsibilities or account is to ensure that your team members know what they're supposed to do and have the tools and resources to do that job what does the pm box talk about in terms of tailoring project resources what is a number of things here the first is diversity they're pretty light on this description all they're just curious but what is the diversity background of the team i'd really encourage you to think more there's excellent research that shows the the less diverse a project team the less the less likely you will be to cover off all the potential quality issues to tie this back to the quality module by diversity i mean things like where are people from what kind of culture did you grow up in are you male or a female or some other gender is there a particular cultural background or experience such as being a person of color or something else being able to understand who you're are serving is very important and we don't ever serve one population exclusively even within an example that might come close there'll will be other things like location and age and experience that will differentiate those things diversity proven to be of strong value in organizations and i encourage you to build your teams in using that that philosophy the physical location where people are particularly when you have remote teams or global teams things like do we have the right physical equipment in the right place do we have to move it for a particular milestone or deadline but also what time zones are people and then things like that the the book talks about industry specific resources doesn't seem like one of the most important on the list but you know different industries will have different resources particularly if you look at something like mining or other resource extraction jobs petroleum things like that there could definitely some some very specific resources acquisition of team members how are you gonna build your team are you are do you need to hire are you to calling them from other departments so will they have a full time or part time a allot meant to the project and how will the team be managed are there already organizational tools manage the team and the development or do new ones need to be established are their team members have special needs well the team needs special training to manage diversity things like that and then lastly the life cycle approach this is quite important because the life cycle approach can have significant impacts on the kind of resources that a project requires and that flows very nicely into talking about agile and adaptive environments so let's take a look at projects with high variability sorry let's take a look at how projects with high variability benefit from team structures that maximize focus and collaboration in particular self organizing teams with general specialists so that's a lot of words in a fairly technical definition really they're they're talking about agile software teams not exclusively software but that's a very good definition of scrum software teams we wanna make sure that these teams are able to collaborate to to boost productivity and facilitate problem solving we wanna make sure that we're able to have those teams accelerate the their work and improve communications be flexible and and who does what and other things like that we wanna take boat sorry when looking at this we wanna make sure that we're planning for physical and human resources in a way that matches agile environments or project life cycles because it's much less predictable these environments agreements for fast supply and lean methods are really important to ensure that you control costs and achieve the schedule of that here's the plan resource management slide and here is the flow chart i'd like to take a moment to take a look at this assignment matrix this comes from the plan resources section but is very valuable if you haven't heard of ra take a look in the book also if you just look up race there's is a great wikipedia article on it but it's the idea that you created matrix with each activity as the rows and each column is a team member or group it could be different departments as well and each intersection is indicated with a letter r ac for responsible accountable consult form in this case this says who is responsible to do the work who is accountable so who needs to measure the work and approve it and manage changes who needs to be consulted for input before work is done or before changes are accomplished and who needs to be informed that work has been done this can be an extremely helpful tool to help your organization or we help your project be very very clear on who is responsible for what this also comes from the plan resource section but it's also quite valuable so wanted to make sure we took some time to look at it the team at charter works a lot like a project charter it establishes clear expectations so that the entire team knows what is acceptable and what the agreement is you we can see six key things here things like team values conflict resolution meeting guidelines those sorts of things ensuring you have an early commitment is a great way to decrease misunderstandings and stop the waste of time in in terms of spinning your wheels around sorting out these kinds of working agreements or the protocols of how a team will work the team charter is best when the team develops it so we definitely don't wanna impose a team charter this is the kind of thing that would definitely be different in every project because each project will have a different group of people and different deliverables and different processes so the team can work together to optimize the team charter for each project it's also very likely there'll be new members and things like that what's really important what a team charter is that all project team members share a responsibility for earn the rules documented that that they're all followed the team can be the charter can be reviewed and updated from time to time perhaps monthly or something else very much dependent on the overall timeline of your project but this is critical to make sure that the team continues to buy in be aligned with the team charter and identify anything that isn't working and updated and that is project resource management
Unit 4 - Topic 4 - Manage Team.webm: next we have manage team manage team is defined in the pi the pm box as the process of tracking team members performance providing feedback back resolving issues and managing team changes to optimize project performance let's take a look at the process flow chart we see the familiar pattern of inputs tools and techniques and outputs and for reference will take a short look at the managed team flow chart one of the less complicated ones but not not the simplest one either so let's start with the managed team inputs quite a few things here project management plan project documents or performance reports team performance assessments and then of course ee and organizational process assets the project management plan is relatively straightforward we need to use that to understand what work needs to be done and what resources we have in terms of project documents we need to focus on issue log lessons that are learned the project team assignment and the team charter which we just took a look at let's talk about work performance reports these are the physical or electronic representations of works of just the reports of of work performance that are intended to generate decisions actions or just provide awareness typically upwards but think of these as dashboards dashboards or status or progress reports on the performance that of the work that has been done so far we need to take a look at team performance assessments this the project management team makes ongoing formal and informal assessments of the team's performance it's very important that this is a continuous and ongoing activity so that actions can be taken to resolve any issues modify communications resolve conflicts or just improve how the team interacts overall in terms of ee f's the core thing to look at here is understand your hr management policies but i'd also consider things that are not mentioned in the pm box in particular any kind of particular a training support conflict resolution coaching other things like that that are available in your that are part of the organizational culture and then lastly around op the pm box lists certificates of appreciation corporate apparel and other organizational perks this this seems short to me and both in terms of length but also a little bit short sighted i think there's a lot of other things that we could look at in terms of managing teams from organizational process assets i do like the sort of of the idea of appreciation here i think there's a lot of programs for showing appreciation or celebrating success but also part to give different team members new responsibilities such as leading a demo or chair a meeting many different kinds of opportunities here that don't need to be limited to giving a gift or a token of appreciate to your team in terms of tools and techniques we have three key things here and are personal and team skills the project management information system and meetings this is relatively straightforward in terms of interpersonal and team skills there's five things here and we'll actually address them in the next slide in terms of the project management information system or pm mis this can be extremely important for managing assigning tracking and controlling work assignment and the actual work itself and then lastly if we're gonna manage the team we definitely have to meet in some way in terms of that first in tool the personal and team skills a couple of things here sorry five things here conflict management decision making emotional intelligence influencing in leadership some of these are very broad i don't wanna do a deep dive on this here but i will refer you to section nine point five point two point one it's definitely worth a close reading if you feel you could benefit from improving nav skills it's a good short overview next we'll take a look at a direct and manage project work outputs four key things here change requests project management plan updates project document updates and ee updates in terms of change requests there could be significant changes that are requested particularly if they involve staffing or personnel these could be made by choice or uncontrollable events so i think that's in from the pm box that's a nice way of saying somebody leaves the organization or somebody is un voluntarily exited from the organization other possible situations would be a a change in capacity on an existing or a directorate or unit department of your organization and somebody who has been conduit or allocated your team is no longer available lots of different options for what happens here but any of those changes to the staff or the makeup of the teams will be very disruptive and this disruption you can cause this schedule to slip or for instance if you had to hire a external vendor to fill the role to at to fix the capacity problem this could also affect your budget staffing changes include moving people to different assignments outsourcing some of the work or replacing team members who leave in terms of project management plan updates we're gonna wanna take a look at the resource management plan but also reassess the schedule baseline and the cost baseline line in terms of project document updates this managing the team needs to focus on the issue log lessons learned in team assignments lastly in terms of enterprise environmental factors the lessons learned or the experiences experiences of your project can be an input for organizational performance appraisal or understanding and identifying gaps and personnel skills which can be solved either by talent acquisition by hiring people to fill those gaps or by identifying opportunities for professional development that lines up nicely with the idea of team development and that is manage team
Unit 4 - Topic 5 - Project Risk Management.webm: next we'll take a look at project risk management defined in the pm box as the process of conducting risk management planning identification analysis response planning and so on the whole idea is how do you best predict possible negative outcomes and then mitigate those with planning here we have the overall project risk section once again we will be doing the inter section of this section and then we'll do a deep dive on section eleven point two identifying risks to be clear that means the sections we are not covering our plan risk management perform quality risk analysis perform quantitative risk analysis plan risk response implement risk responses and monitor risks this isn't to indicate that they're not important but in the interest of being able to cover this material within the time we have i'm focusing on identifying risks as the key part of knowledge to focus on so what are the key concepts for risk management well we need to take a look at constraints and assumptions individual project risk overall project risk and the risk tolerance of the organization i really want you to keep in mind that risk management is an exercise in predicting the future and then trying to mitigate potential and likely risk in terms of constraints and assumptions we we know that organizations need to choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner every part of your project will expose the organization to some sort of risk so each of those decisions needs to be a cost benefit analysis to take on the right risk in order to create value but ultimately balancing risk and reward individual project risk is that uncertain events or conditions that you know if they happen will have a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives typically when we talk about risk we think more on the negative side positive effects could be great typically going under budget or under schedule is not seen as a risk but that is one way of looking at it of more importantly any deviation from plan could have ultimately a negative effect in in achieving the outcomes for instance if if an early phase ended early ended ahead of schedule i mean to saying then we could see a lot of weight and waste time by the team so understanding r is not only looking at the negative overall project risk takes a look at what kind of uncertainty there in the project of the whole so this isn't looking at the individual objective level of risks but what risk is there to the entire project so this is going to represent the exposure of stakeholders to the implication of of the different the different variations in project outcome both in terms of positive and negative excuse me lastly we'll take a look at look at words tolerance when you are thinking about how to manage risk on a particular project the whole team needs to know what the level of risk exposures is acceptable as they work towards the objectives of the project this is gonna be defined by the measurable risk threshold that reflect the risk tolerance of the organization but particularly the project stakeholders and amongst them particularly of the projects sponsor risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective keeping in mind that negative variations typically have a much lower threshold than positive variations lastly risk tolerance is is explicitly stated and communicated to project team and reflected in the definitions of risk impact for the entire project this is quite important if you don't have alignment on the risk tolerance then if you're increasing the chance that an individual team member may exceed the risk threshold of the project and expose the project to risk that's not acceptable by the organization typically that would be seen as pretty significant gap or failure what are the considerations for project risk tailoring well there are four key things here project size project complexity project important importance and the development approach so as we look at the risk the size of the project but let's keep in let's keep in mind what we mean by size here this could be budget duration scope or just the team size or any combination of those does that size require a more detailed approach to risk management the idea of this typically is that as we have more and more resources allocated to a particular project that the risk of something going wrong is higher because the failure or a gap in performance or quality could cost the organization more in terms of project complexity we need to look at how complex it is the project and do we have the right set of innovation technology commercial arrangement things like that to accommodate that is this a very simple project that a reduced risk process is enough and when we think about complexity there's all those things that i talked about but also how many departments are involved every department that is involved will increase the complexity how many organizations are there third party organizations involved what is the geographic location time zones can have a significant impact but i think something that the pm box doesn't talk about that i would think could that significantly impact the idea or the measurement of project complexity is has this organization or this team done this kind of work before that kind of learning in within a a project can significantly increase or skew the complexity of it compared to what it looks like on paper so i encourage you to think about that next let's talk about project importance is this a strategic project is it tactical is it a nice to have is it a need to have does the fate of the organization rests on the soul shoulders of that of this project being successful the level risk could be increased for the project because it aims to produce a breakthrough opportunity or we'll have very very high value or as i said maybe you are in a dual die situation where you perhaps you the competitive response to the marketplace and this is the only option that we can feel that can be successful so understanding how important the project is can actually can definitely affect taking on more risk sometimes though this isn't mentioned in the in the pm box in this section we could see the opposite that high very high important or high stakes project sometimes brings down the risk tolerance and and the organization particularly executives become very risk ave ave in that situation which can actually have a similar negative impact on the overall project of making of not providing enough degrees of freedom for the project team to to get the work done so very important to understand that and try to identify where you are on project complexity project importance early on so that you can be having the right conversations with stakeholders and and your sponsor to identify the right risk threshold lastly what is the development approach is this a a predictive waterfall project is everything gonna be sick hence sequential and iterative or are we doing an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration or each time box as we go along very very important understand those are vastly different methodologies for both development but also managing risk so that's next let's talk about agile and adaptive environments and how we manage risk in fact this is one of the key reasons that agile software development in particular was created to try to d risk or reduce the risk of these very large monolithic projects that would take years to to complete and then when they were done they wouldn't deliver the value that they were promised there's some very famous books about this marching the deaf spirals one of them take a look at some of those things if you if you'd like to learn more about that to address this projects that use an adaptive or agile approach make use of frequent reviews and incremental work and together so we in software agile software development we would talk about sprints and demos and retrospective and these things together create smaller amounts of work smaller batches of work is the word i was looking for allows risk to be reviewed on a more regular basis it also means that each increment risks less because there's a less at stake which is a one of the one of the key ideas of agile software development risk is going to be considered when selecting the content of each so what are you pulling i'm gonna stick with the software model right now so what are you pulling in from the backlog to each sprint and risks will also be identified and manage during each iteration the other thing to keep in mind is that the requirements when you're working in the way typically are a living document that's updated regularly often as like every other week so that work may be quickly and rapidly rep as the project progresses based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure the key thing here is to understand is that agile or adaptive a project life cycles are really trying to gear are really trying to gear them towards continual learning so that you're able to adapt and respond to the needs of the project as you go a common theme of what i've been saying is that change management project management service management many ways this is all different forms of trying to predict the future so if you if you narrow the scope of how far in the future you're trying to predict say two weeks as opposed to say two years than this gives us a much better chance of being successful and that ends manage team project risk management
Unit 4 - Topic 6 - Identify Risks.webm: now we'll take a look at identify risks identify risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk and documenting their characteristics this is necessarily an iterative process since new risks may be presented or discovered as the project progresses through its life cycle and that means the level of overall project risk will also change throughout the progress of the project the frequency iteration of participation in this process of risk identification will vary by situation by a project and but does need to be defined in the risk management plan here we have our inputs tools and techniques process overflow and a relatively simple flow chart for identifying risk so let's take a look at the identify risk inputs a few things here including one new one we've a project management plan project documents agreements procurement documentation which is new e e and op so in terms of the project management plan we wanna make sure that we're looking at the risk management plan but also scope baseline schedule baseline and cost baseline lines it's very important that we understand what the expected baseline of of the project is because identifying risk is all about identifying variations or v from those baseline lines in terms of project documents we wanna make sure that we're looking at the assumption log cost estimates duration s estimates issue log lessons learned requirements documentation resource requirements and stakeholder register seems like allotted it it is that's most of the project documents i wanna pay particular tissue attention to the issue log in in and second the assumption log these two parts of the project documentation can help identify potential risks by looking at what the current and existing issues are and to continually back check that with the assumptions log agreements are a very important part here especially when we're looking at complex or legally binding agreement so that would typically be with an external vendor or an external stakeholder who might have a testing or a review or perhaps even a an approval process or stop with as part of the project taking a look at procurement documentation this is a really important the reason this is here is because a huge focus of risk is on cost i mean in terms of scope and schedule those are very important things as well but very few risks are harder to mitigate or have more impact on an organization than losing money particularly if it's just through pure waste or through misunderstanding or not meeting the obligations of a procurement agreement so the documentation of how much things will cost when payment is due late fees and things like that are quite essential in terms of ee you wanna look at what you have in terms of published material fees but what this really means is what do you have in terms of existing risk checklists what sort of benchmarking results do you have are there academic studies or industry studies of similar projects that you can take a look at and then in terms of op we have project files process controls risk statement formats checklists from similar projects i'd like to take a moment just to really reinforce how important and how effective checklists can be checklist provide a regular and formal way that's highly repeatable and scalable for any member of the team to be able to provide sign off and check off when i say checklist i don't just mean a list of items or or criteria with the checks next them but ideally that checklist form once it needs to have sufficient audit ability what does that mean or what do i mean by that what we need to know what the checklist was for when it was filled out who filled it out and who tracked each item ideally there's lots of really great online tools that can help with this even some things like google sheets in google forms summer options with office three six five where microsoft sixty five exist as well one of the benefits of moving this online is that you don't have to typically look for them you don't have to find the files that are complete with a a little bit of organization they're they should be easy to find it but also digitally searchable but the other key thing is because especially when we're working for a professional organization typically we'll have a an organizational count for using these kinds of tools then a few things like who filled it out what did they fill out or when did they fill it out all those things are gonna be sort of auto magically tracked in virgin history and things like that so one are the tools and techniques to identify risks well pretty long list here we have expert judgment data gathering and analysis into personal and team skills again not surprising of the prompt list which is quite new and this is the only time we see prompt list and i'll i'll talk about what those three words are next to there and then of course meetings so the pm box does not have much to say in terms of expert judgment just simply based on the project so experts in the domain space who can help evaluate potential risk but in particular anyone who's done the kind of thing before when you're identifying risk there's very little substitute for experience in terms of data gathering this really is how do we identify potential risks well there's not a lot of options we could brainstorm we could review past checklists to see if anything applies and we can interview people in terms of data analysis there are a couple of things here as assumption and constraint analysis document analysis the two key things that would really focus on its root cause analysis and we've already talked about that but the sw analysis and the next slide will actually address that so i'll i'll wait for that to talk about what a sw analysis if you're not familiar in terms of interpersonal and team skills a skilled facilitator can be a tremendous benefit it can help the team members potential even stakeholders stay focused on the risk identification task can be quite a a difficult and challenging process they can follow the method associated with the technique accurately ensure that we that the output is a clearest description identifying and overcome sources of bias and also resolve any disagreements that are that i that may arise they don't talk about this in the in the pe but for me the reason they're talking about a skilled lit is that that's an external person not to your organization but to the project team and talking about risk can get quite emotional very fast if the right culture and the right tone is inset then people will will quickly shift to a sense of having to defend themselves from blame so that's why the we have this kind of description of a the way that a skilled facilitator could help so a prompt list is a a way of thinking about or structuring a risk analysis so earlier in data gathering and we talked about checklists i i think that these prompt kind of fit they're very broad though so i i think that what the pe box means with checklist and data gathering be something very specific to your organization and and existing processes but we have three options we see here a pest tea cup in v so these are acronyms the first one pass stands for political economic social technological legal environmental so as you can see what they mean by a prompt list is a list of of concepts or domains that we that you could think through and use this to prompt your discovery or your identification of potential risk to your project tea comps down stands for technical environmental commercial operational and political and then lastly we have vu volatility uncertainty complex in ambiguity lastly we have meetings in particular what the pm box here is referring to his risk workshops which is an opportunity to brainstorm once again they recommend bringing in a skilled facilitator that's to and but they also talk about tailor invite tailoring the invite list to the science and the needs of the project which is a tact waves saying you don't need to invite everyone sometimes a very large group could make this kind of work more complicated okay so let's take a look at that swat analysis that i brought up little while ago and let's spend a little bit more time on this if you haven't seen this it's a simple two by two grid and swat is another acronym that stands for strength weakness opportunity and threats i'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this but if you've never heard of this then i'm gonna recommend go just google or search some articles on it the wiki wikipedia article is is quite good and here we have an example or or an example of the format rather where you're able to look at let list all the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats that are currently facing whatever the analysis is focused on in this case it would be or project so we can think of what i really like about this particular rendering or this particular depiction of the want grid is the fact that it has is helpful harmful dimension and then internal or external origin so we can see the things that are helpful in internal or strengths things that are internal and harmful our weaknesses but what as we shift external if it's helpful and external then that's gonna be an opportunity and it'll be a threat if it's external and harmful this is a very useful tool because it's well recognized and well understood it's pretty common globally in fact although i'm sure there are places where it's less useful i i i've seen this used in many different places around the world it's very easy to understand and it allows you to quickly categorize and can be very useful in that kind of risk workshop that we were just talking about so what are the outputs of identifying risk well three key things here the risk register a risk report and project document updates of course so what is a risk register well you know each individual project risk is given a unique identifier and the risk register this is a key thing when we talk about registers versus logs or lessons learned library or something like that when we talk about a register it's important that we give each item that unique identifier and these identify risks are then described in as much detail as is needed to make sure that there's no misunderstanding about what that risk is so then there's two more pieces we need to attach on that the potential risk owner where the potential risk owner has been identified during this process and the risk owners is listed in the risk register that needs to connect with when you're performing qualitative risk analysis processes but this means that if this risk if we wanna mitigate this risk who's the owner so they need to be informed have some influence or make some decisions but also if we actually encounter the risk this is typically the person who needs to engage it and then also the risk register needs to consider what are the potential responses there's not much point at identifying risks and not up putting together a plan on how to mitigate or respond to the risk so we're a potential risk response has been identified and listed in the risk register then we also record those different possible responses and you can confirm that during the planned risk response process so the next output is a risk report this per provides an overall summary on the on overall project risk but can also identify individual project risks as well it's important these two things are kept in mind the risk report is developed progressively in in an ongoing way throughout the project risk management process and in fact if any major risk is actually encountered or any major change happens to the project for instance gets delayed by three months or shortened by three months or six people are removed from a already double the budget in any of those kinds of situations it's gonna be important to come back and reassess the risk in terms of the project document update assumption log issue login lessons learned register and that is identifying risks
Unit 4 - Topic 7 - Project Communication Management.webm: next we'll take a look at project communications management defined in the pm box as processes necessary to ensure the information needs of the project and its stakeholders are met throughout the development of artifacts and implementation of activities designed to achieve effective information exchange here we once again see a very technical for something relatively simple how do you make sure that the right people know the right information at the right time of course it is the fact that it's simple does not mean that it's easy so let's take a look it's very important to keep in mind that effective communication is all about building a bridge between all of your different stakeholders and there could be quite a diversity in those and they may have different cultural and organizational backgrounds as well as different levels of expertise perspectives and interest in particular they may have varying levels of understanding of what it is the project is setting out to accomplish what the complexities are associated with it and and and why it is important or why is should be important to them the fundamental attributes of effective communication is all about developing the a way to be able to share and the artifacts that you use to share that information so clarity on the purpose of the communication is always something you wanna start with understanding as much as possible about who your audience is who will be receiving this communication and that make sure that you're focused on meeting the needs and preferences of that particularly important with the key stakeholders and your sponsor and then lastly monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of your communications so we can take a look at the overall project communication overview here once again we'll be taking a look at the introduction of one key piece here ten point two managed communications will not be covering the rest means we'll we'll will not be looking at planned communications management or monitor communications so what are the key concepts of project communication well we have five four things here communication mechanism communication dimensions then we'll look at the five c's of communication and patient scales in terms of communication mechanism this is how is the communication being delivered is it written spoken is it just some kind of media electronic we also wanna think about things like is it formal or informal what are your choice of words but in particular how are you delivering the message a live presentation versus a document versus a recorded video all have very different requirements to be effective and successful next we wanna look at communication dimensions is this in internal communication or to external is it formal does it speak with the voice of the organization or is it informal meant for internal consumption particularly by the project team what is the hierarchical article focus by that we mean from your position or the position of the project what is the relative location of the audience in the orc chart are you this an upward focus up to executives management board of directors something like that is it downward towards a frontline staff or is it horizontal it peers in the project management organization or other managers then also lastly is it written or oral and things like that the five c's are interesting and i think useful m monica or way to remember a couple of key ideas each of these start with a c so correct grammar and spelling concise expression clear purpose coherent ideas and controlling flow of ideas i like this it's certainly not the only method that i would recommend but i think it's a good one and it's included in this section of the pm box lastly what are the communication skills that one needs to be aware of and hopefully be skilled in to be able to effectively manage communications a long list of things here listening actively awareness of cultural or personal differences i think that's particularly important your i would also describe that by having empathy empathy for your audience in addition setting identifying setting and managing stakeholder expectations is quite important in fact you'll know that there's some extra material in this section that covers stakeholder management even though we're not going over all of the stakeholder management section which is its own section in the pm box then we move on to things like persuasion motivation coaching negotiation and resolving conflict so let's take a look at the recommended options for tailoring project communications here we have stakeholders physical location communication technology language and knowledge management so understanding who your stakeholders are is a key part of understanding who your audiences your stakeholders throughout the project will be one of your primary audiences in particular do you have internal and or external stakeholders and do you need to adapt or provide separate communications for those audiences what is the physical location of team members are you c located are you in the same time zone are you a distributed team all very key things if you are a a a if you are a fully remote team then your communication requirements are going to be higher face to face or presence communication has a lot of benefit in that you can communicate a lot you can communicate quickly and it's very easy to have an organic conversation when you have a pure remote situation in that case you have to be much more deliberate and intentional with your communication that ties very nicely into the next point of communication technologies how do you tailor your project to choose the right technologies first what is available to develop record transmit tracks store all of the artifacts what tools are you using most organizations are gonna have an investment in a office suite such as google suite or microsoft three sixty five but there are certainly many other tools and specialty tools that could be quite important chat tools are increasingly popular these days things like slack ms teams or even discord looking at what technologies are most appropriate cost effective for your communications but especially to stakeholders particularly challenging situation is can be when you have different departments using different tools that's becoming less and less common but what is still quite common is if you have external stakeholders making sure they're able to see your artifacts and then be able to respond and comment to them is something that we need to keep in mind let's take a look at language next this is a very important factor in how we communicate is there just one language used or are there many languages have allowances been made to adjust for the complexity of team members from my from a diverse language group not only does this matter in terms of making we're effectively communicating but if you are in a multilingual ling environment then we need to make sure that we're using relatively neutral and idiom free language so we're not using common phrases or cliches or other things like that that are less well known for people who are not natural born speakers then lastly what is the knowledge management of the organization and how are we gonna use that keep in mind that a communications strategy is of for a project is very much based on what artifacts are we gonna create so what are the documents what are the posters what are the presentations what are the emails all those kinds of artifacts what do we need to create and maintain and then when we put that in the context of tailoring around knowledge management what what kind of storage or repository do we have in the organization so that this material can be easily referenced and shared but another very important thing looking at tools such as cloud based file storage once again thinking about google suite and a microsoft three sixty five is having a central location when you have multiple copies of the same document in circulation it's very easy for them to be drift or some kind of variation or deviation from the most important or most current version of that document or artifacts so leveraging a central tool such as a knowledge management repository or a cloud based sharing based collaborative file platform such as google drive or onedrive can be very helpful let's take a look at agile and adaptive environments in terms of communication one of the key things that we've addressed several times is the pace of change that we are looking at short time boxes often such as two weeks sprints and things like that so based on that weight of change and because agile projects again i'm focusing primarily on agile software practices because we have a regular cadence of updates and decisions being based on being made as we go as we learn it's essential to be able to communicate these evolving and emerging details in a way that is easy to access and regularly engaging to the stakeholders this can definitely provide the motivation to streamline team member access for information and also frequent checkpoints or c locating team this is another very popular option again can't be done if you're pure remote i'll take time to mention that the daily scrum or a five minute stand up meeting definitely falls into this category and should be considered not only in agile software practices but i i think there's excellent my personal experience and excellent research that indicates that daily stand ups four teams can be quite effective lastly making sure that you're sharing your project communication so whatever those artifacts are in an easy to access transparent way and that you provide regular stakeholder reviews can really help promote communication with management stakeholders that's a comment that's provided here in the pm box on agile adaptive environments but i would say that last point that sharing that those artifacts and a transparent away and having regular reviews that's just a good a a good piece of advice or a good practice for any project and that is project communication management
Unit 4 - Topic 8 - Manage Communications.webm: next we'll take a look at manage communications manage communications is defined as the process of ensuring timely inappropriate collection and a number of other the things of project information the key benefit of this process is that it enables the efficient and effective flow of information between the project team and the stakeholders i would also make sure that we're thinking about communication within the project team especially if it's made up of many different members from different departments this process of managing communication is of course performed throughout the project the the managed communications process needs to identify all the aspects of effective communication this is gonna include things like which technologies are we're gonna use what methods to communicate and what techniques in addition we also need to make sure that with our communications management we're being sufficiently flexible in communicating activities allowing adjustments in the method and techniques to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders throughout the life of the project here we have the inputs tools and techniques for manage communications and we'll briefly take a look at the flow chart as well so i wanna take a look at communication techniques they're listed in the introduction in this quite a number of them and i think it's worth making sure we take a look at each of these the first communication technique is the sender receiver model this incorporates feedback loops to ensure that interaction and participation is happening and to remove barriers for effective communication this next we need to take a look at choice of media so what decisions we make about how we produce the communication artifacts this needs to be tailored to the the specific project needs keep for example think about when you need to present something in writing when you need do something verbally when you need an informal memo versus the formal memo when to you use push or pull options in which technology technologies to use the pm box doesn't really talk about push or pull options but i think this is an important thing to cover in case you're unfamiliar a push communication is where you send it out to everyone all the the audience a pull option is when those who are interested are able to pull let me give you a further example an email would be an example of a push option but a weekly updated slide deck where any person any of the stakeholders has access to it on this shared drive can look at it whenever they choose that would be a pull option next let's talk about writing style we need to make sure that we're making the appropriate use of active versus passive voice sentence instruct and word choice overall writing style can communicate a lot and needs to match the needs of your organization capture and of course the project as well the pm box doesn't address this specifically here but i do think writing style connects quite closely with your enterprise environmental factors there could in fact be a style guide or or templates for communication and lastly there could be examples of how to communicate in that come from op meeting management is very important we see meetings come up repeatedly as a tool and technique throughout the different processes of project management making sure that you are preparing an agenda in inviting essential participants and ensuring they're attending something that's not mentioned theirs making sure that you're not inviting people who don't need to be there having more people in a meeting typically leads to longer meetings with more complex discussion so limiting it to the essential participants can be a very effective strategy making sure that we deal with conflicts within the meeting or that result from inadequate follow up is very important this means that we need to have minutes and actions and understand the attendance so that we're able to manage and control the our meeting process presentations keep in mind that when you give a presentation there's lots going on there body language and design of visual aids and things like that and we'll see that in this course with presentation assignments next is facilitation this is the process of leading a group but not being in charge is very much leader not boss in being and working to build consensus agreement ensuring that the that group is able to overcome their objections and obstacles and get aligned and be able to work together this can involve things like challenging group dynamics interpersonal friction maintaining interest enthusiasm and engagement throughout both the facilitation for facilitation session but also overall throughout the project and then lastly is active listening listening actively is all about acknowledging clarifying confirming ensuring that you understand and remove any barriers that a negatively affect comprehension in this section of of the pm box each of these communication techniques have a longer more detailed description and they're linked in in your textbook so if you'd like to learn more about any of them or if my short description wasn't sufficient please take a look at those now we'll take a look at managing communication inputs here we have a number of things i think all we're familiar with now in terms of the project management plan oh we need to look at the resource management plan the communications plan and the stakeholder engagement plan really wanna emphasize how important stakeholder engagement and management is to the success of a project once you start to lose the interest faith or confidence of your stakeholders i wanna be very clear your project success is at high risk in terms of project documents we're looking at the change log issue log lessons learned register quality report risk report and stakeholder register quite a long list there communications is foundational to successful projects we've already talked about work performance reports how what are the status or progress reports that you're showing or using to communicate the performance and progress of the work that is addressed by the project in terms of environmental enterprise environmental factors the organizational culture is very important as well as the stakeholder risk threshold especially so this is brought up in the pm box to really focus on what is your stakeholder risk threshold around x external communications because companies have experienced tremendous negative outcomes through poor communications beyond that also looking at what are the established communication channels particularly looking at your organization from a local office to regional and potentially even global needs and then in terms of organizational process assets what are the corporate policies and procedures for social media ethics and security also organizational communication requirements we have to take a look at what are the guidelines for the development and storage and retrieval information that ties back to knowledge management systems and also the historical information from previous previous projects particularly looking at their artifacts to their communications as examples as much as possible i wanna loop back for a second back of that social media ethics and security it's not necessarily the case that your project needs to use any of those tools but it's very important that if your project is confidential if there's a non disclosure agreement if it is proprietary that the members of the team including yourself are not leaking any of that information in any way by inappropriately discussing it in the public place by talking about it on social media or chatting in about it on online using personal tools that don't have encryption or so i wanted to make sure i added a little bit of depth to why i think that's so important on this list next we'll take a look at manage communication tools and techniques a along list here with some new things the first one is communication technologies in the core question here is where is the team c located where are you all in relation to each other and also based on that what are the security protocol that needed such as encryption or password protection on video conferences access to shirt documents i've already talked about the google suite and microsoft three sixty five suite things like that next are looking at communication methods what what are the needs of all of your stakeholders and how can you be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs the audience of those different stakeholders we've talked quite a bit about communication skills already so this is really just focusing the tools and techniques around what are your competencies around communication how are you getting feedback how effective you are are you at presenting and also what are your non nonverbal verbal communication skills the project information management information system you know this is the that electronic project management tool this can be very closely tied to electronic communications it can actually be used to notify people of updates also it could provide alerts to change status or achieving milestones or things like that project reporting this is probably the most important or significant tour technique on the list of the majority of project communication is some sort of reports out to to the organization or to stakeholders project reporting is the act of collecting and distributing project information quite simply that's information is distributed to many groups of stakeholders and needs to be adapted so the right information in the right way such as appropriate level format level of detail is provided for each stakeholder or group of stakeholders this could be as simple as as an email to more elaborate custom reports or presentations or even bound printed reports these need to happen both on a regular basis throughout the project but also there could be a need for a one time or one off report where the last thing on this list is into personal and team skills we've already talked about these quite a bit the list of things highlighted here are active listening conflict management cultural awareness meeting management networking and political awareness so now we'll move on to the manage communication outputs four key things here project communications these are all of the artifacts that we've talked about so these are performance reports deliverable status schedule progress budget updates cost incurred all those presentations and whenever other information required by stakeholders looking next at what project management plan updates you would would be an output of managed communications this would be the communications management plan but also the stakeholder engagement plan and we'll talk more about that in the next topic in terms of project document updates we wanna be looking or focusing on the issue log lessons learned the project schedule risk register and the stakeholder register and then lastly in terms of organizational of assets project records such as correspondence memos meeting minutes and other documents used on the project in the planned and ad hoc project report and presentation so as you're going along and modifying and adapting and refining these kinds of artifacts make sure that you're taking a look at the way that you could update the templates or the standard methods and stored methods of of those communications and that is manage communications
Unit 4 - Topic 9 - Project Stakeholder Management.webm: and next we'll take a look at project stakeholder management so this is defined in the pm box as the process required to identify the people groups organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project this is because of that influence sort that impact by the project could very likely be influenced back on the project or on the success of the project i wanna be very clear that this is an entire section of the pm box much like we've looked at and then and the number of other top that we just covered however we are not going go into a deep dive of this at all we're not even treating this as its own unit because we've that covered so much material already however stakeholder management is so important i wanted to make sure we gave it at least some time so that you have some visibility on it that being said while stakeholder management is key to project success it is quite a bit more of an advanced skill and is not as relevant if you have not mastered the fundamentals yet this is why i've prioritized this to have some visibility in our in our material for this course but is not a strong focus this so let's briefly take a look at the key concepts of stakeholder management sorry the slide should have got updated this are this is stakeholder management key concepts we here we have stakeholder identification and engagement management and then satisfaction so this is all around how do we know who they are how do we engage them how do we get them excited and active in our project how we manage them throughout the project and how we make sure they're satisfied by the end so the ability of a project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all stakeholders can mean the difference between project success and failure so to give yourself the best chance of success with your project we wanna make sure that we start this process of identifying and engaging stakeholders as as early as possible ideally as soon as the project manager has been assigned in the gene begins to form we wanna make sure that we are not thinking that this is a single time effort this is not a one and done situation this is gonna be an iterative ongoing process throughout the entire project and especially stakeholder management is definitely continuous we're need to make sure that we're communicating a faculty with them we're addressing their risk thresholds they understand the value and support it ideally they are getting some or the beneficiary of some of that value they're getting regular updates and have a clear channel for feedback and influence on the project now stakeholder satisfaction is and is a very important objective that i would encourage you to put into every project and the key to doing this effectively is to focus on the continuous communication with all stakeholders stakeholder satisfaction does not come from checking the box and saying you placed an order three months ago with this project here's the deliverable it's very unlikely that that will be a a positive or or a a satisfactory outcome for the stakeholder you need to make sure that you understand their needs and expectations address issues as they occur throughout the process of the project as well as manage the conflicting interest that could arise between stakeholders and also foster an an appropriate engagement to ensure that they have the right level of project involvement around decisions and potentially activities so how do we tailor a stakeholder management well three key things around stakeholder diversity the complexity of relationship and communication to technologies so how many stakeholders are there how diverse the culture within this stakeholder community this certainly could be around cultural themes gender but also are they internal or external or are there some divisions of this organization that are that have a very of substantive different culture in my experience a not in a negative way but you know development engineering and sales those are two organizations within a company that have very different cultures and those stakeholders are gonna care about very different things next is what is the complexity of your relationship with them this has a lot of many stakeholders there are but also how many networks does that stakeholder or stakeholder group participate and the more complex that networks how of information networks they participate participated in the more ways or direction they may be getting information about your project but also potentially misinformation or just second hand or third to hand information so it's important to understand that and hopefully create a clear and consistent channel with each stakeholder or stakeholder group lastly what is the technology you'll be using we we very rarely aren't gonna be using some form of technology to be updating stakeholders so what is available and what's the what can we what choices can we make to maximize the opportunity to create lots of value to you know around that stakeholder of communication so that they understand and that it's two way it's very important that you're not just sending out mass emails that you never look at you know i think video calls or live chats or things like that if you can't meet face to face is very important so let's next take a look at agile adaptive environments as we wrap up this last topic face you know to facilitate timely discussions and decision making adaptive teams often engage your stakeholders directly instead of going through other people particularly layers of management this is a very common theme that you'll see especially in agile software development so for example the client user and developer would exchange information in a c creative process this is intended and is successful when there's more stakeholder involvement and we see a pretty strong correlation to hire stakeholder satisfaction in those situations regularly scheduled interactions with a stakeholder community so this is those if we look at agile software development these are the the ceremonies things like demos and and and planning meetings and things like that of these kinds of interactions help mitigate risk help build trust and support adjustments early in the project cycle and those tend to give us outcomes like reducing cost and increasing the likelihood of success if you wanna accelerate the sharing of information within an cross an organization then an in using agile methods what you need to do is need to promote really aggressive transparency so all of your work items in jira being viewable by any stakeholders so that you can see the state of work during a spring sprint at any time would be an example of that inviting them to a planning meeting or to a demo for or would be other good examples sharing public art of artifacts sorry sharing project artifacts like a a design diagram or an architecture diagram or personas or screenshots wire frames putting them in a public space so that you're able to surface that information to as many people as possible and i an quickly identify any mis alignments misunderstood or missing dependencies or any other issues that would bring risk to your project and that wraps up the last topic on managing stakeholders and also wraps up all of unit four i know that was a lot of content and i appreciate your patience to that this also wraps up our project management content for the course at this time there are still some assignments in other evaluations but in terms of the teaching in the lectures this is the the end of that so please ensure that you've asked any questions around this the we'll be switching to service management soon and next week so i wanna make sure that if there are questions that you have around this topic that you've had the opportunity to ask them before too much time has passed thanks so much
Unit 5 - Topic 2 - Ethics.webm: next we'll take a look at ethics and professional professional conduct of service management so it's important to start with that this is not in the handbook unfortunately there's nothing about ethics in the but not specifically or or explicitly i wanna be really clear that it does not mean that ethics and professional conduct isn't critical to the success of your career or any organization that you work for you know i think the the pm p or the pm rather the pm code of ethics can mostly serve us here it strongly applies but i think an important question to ask is where else can we find ethical guidance for service management and for me the clearest answer is the system administrator code of ethics so this comes from is us and lisa this these are it's the user group for linux administrators and the lo the league of professional system administrators and if you go to lo dot org slash code of ethic you can see what they have there now i have a copy of it here and we're gonna take a a look at this i really appreciate that it starts with professionalism and that integrity is on the list that's quite important privacy is so important as a system administrator or handling back end systems because we have access privileged access to so much data laws and policies it's important that we understand the laws and policy sees this particular part of the code of ethics says that i will educate myself and others on relevant laws regulations and policies regarding the performance of my duties anything like cop or pipe the gdpr those are all privacy pieces of legislation if you work in healthcare hipaa canadian equivalents these are all the kinds of things you you need to be aware of in terms of communication they talk about being clear and honest in your in your communication and that you'll strive to listen and understand the needs of all parties system integrity making sure that we're building good and reliable systems education a commitment to continuing to learn that we have a responsibility to the computing community that we have a social responsibility i this one i think is quite a me informed professional i will encourage the writing and adoption of relevant policy and laws consistent with these ethical principles for and and lastly they have the ethical responsibility and then a number of of other commitments things like i will do my best to make this visions consistent with the safety privacy and well being of my community and the public i encourages you to take a closer look at this and i encourage you to make ethics part of your core practice invariably there will be times you're asked to do things that you're not comfortable and but and the the those can be very challenging knowing what your ethics are and knowing what the ethics and the the code of professional conduct is for your organization is very important now given the fact that this is in fact for system administrators which is yep very close to ideal system management is a you know there's a lot of overlap with bat and system administration but considering that this is the system administrator code of ethics and that told does not explicitly have a code of ethics i thought we'd look at one other option and that's the association of computing machinery i have the link here for what you can see this is a another large organization quite mature and they have some really excellent thoughts on ethics and professional conduct as well so here we have contribute to human and to contribute to society and human well being avoid harm be honest and trust be fair and act or not discriminate respect the work it takes to to produce no ideas respect privacy and honor confidentiality so a lot of overlap here there's also some professional conduct we'll take a look in a moment but you know be honest and trustworthy avoid harm be fair and act not discriminate that you know i i don't think there's any surprises on what would go into a code of ethics and professional conduct and we see some very strong alignment with the kinds of things that are articulated here and the kinds of things that we saw included in the pm bmi code of ethics as well i wanna be particularly i wanna put pay particular focus to be fair and act to not discriminate and that includes algorithm discrimination or we have more and more ai and machine learning and those systems are only as good as the data we put in so we have bias data going into a system i'm sure we're all familiar with the phrase garbage in garbage out if we put garbage data into a system we'll get garbage data out that's just as true for a predictive or ai machine learning system or algorithm them as anything else one last thing is the first one here contribute to society and to human well being there's some additional language here also acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing that's very very important to recognize and into incorporating into how we work and then for respect the work it takes to produce new ideas they also list inventions creative works imp our fact so just a little bit of broadening on that in terms of professional conduct what we have here are professional responsibilities professional leadership principles and compliance with the code itself so i won't read all of this you can certainly go and take a look at it but under professional responsibilities we see things here like strive to achieve high quality in both processes and products of professional work know in respect existing roles pertaining to that work firm work only in areas of competence i think that's very important access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good and then design and implement systems that are robust and usable secure in terms of professional leadership principles we have some very important things here as well ensure that the public good is a central concerned or an all professional computing work principles articulate encourage acceptance of and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization of the group create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals and recognize and take special care systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society so it's very important things that of that have very important consequences and outcomes i did not read everything for professional responsibilities and professional leadership principles because there's there's quite a few of them but i wanted to give you a highlight of some of the key ones and encourage you to think about your ethics and and how you would have a conversation about them especially if you're asked to do something that would contradict those ethics i will go over both items under compliance with the code and by the code mean the ac code of ethics the first one is to uphold promote in respect the principles of the code and the second one is to treat violations of the code as inconsistent with membership in the ac so they make following the code contingent of being a member and good standing and i i strongly support that so that wraps up our section on ethics and professional conduct a little bit different from the pm pm pm bought one due to it not being explicitly in the it handbook but once again i really strongly urge you to think about how ethics intersect with your work as as somebody involved in it and particularly service management
Unit 5 - Topic 3 - Guiding Principles.webm: next we'll take a look at the guiding principles of service management so before we dive into the guiding principles i wanted to take quick look at the service value system this is a very short chapter chapter six that i got this from but i just wanted to make sure that we touched on this in particular this idea of opportunity and and value or opportunity demand so in this diagram grant also overall this is a model that represents all the component components and activities of how an organization of facilitates value creation we've already worked to define things like organization and value so on on the opportunity and demand side these represent the options or possibilities to add value for stakeholders or otherwise improve the organization of course this doesn't i the word value is so important here because it doesn't just mean generate more revenue it could be be more efficient have less waste lower economic sorry environmental impact increased customer satisfaction the ideally all those things will lead to a more profitable successful organization but keep in mind that value doesn't just mean money opportunity in demands are the inputs for the service value system on the other side we have value and this is the outcome of of sbs and this is what is created so we need to we that value could be for have different kinds of values for different stakeholders but that that is the output you can see the guiding principles on the outside of this diagram these are the recommendations that guide an organization regardless of changes in goals strategies or types of work or even your management structure and they're part of the service value system and that's what this section is about we'll take a look at each of the guiding principles governance is the means by which an organization directed and controlled service value chain this is a set of interconnected activities that the organization performs to deliver a viable product or service the and is also an element of his entire system here we also have practices down here these are the ideal practices and there are sets of organizational resources a design for performing the work or accomplishing the objectives and then continual improvement is at the bottom here and the that is a recurring activity performed at all levels to make sure that an organization's performance is aligned with the changing stakeholder expectations so those were a lot of technical definitions and i wanted to make sure we had some visibility of that before we dealt dove in on the topic of continuing improvement they talk about always aligning to changing stakeholder expectations i think the other thing that's very important in it is that the actual technology the landscape of what is possible and what is affordable changes on basically a daily basis so the other very important thing about continue improvement not only about asking how can we do this better but also always looking to the future in the near term horizon us into what could what technologies or processes these practices could we be adopting to improve how we do our work so next let's take a look at the components of the of the service value system what's really important here is that the whole idea of the of sv sbs is designed to prevent an organization from being stuck in silos so silos is a metaphor for departments or or or units of a organization that do not connect or communicate well with the other parts of the organization silos exist when teams or departments end up focusing on just their own area work and don't look at the big picture and don't look at the organization overall or holistically when an organization has one or more silos it's a significant challenge for that out organization to be agile and resilient because it's a very strong constraint on how they're able to communicate and align on shared vision when you have an organization that has silos the you'll know that because you'll see things like an inability to act quickly or take advantage of communities reduced ability to optimize how resources are used across the organization poor decision making poor visibility or a lack of transparency hidden agendas in an increase in unhealthy organizational politics in a lack of clarity of about value streams interfaces and hand off point so that last point i would say that the teams are not able to effectively collaborate with each other i wanna be clear that those symptoms don't absolutely mean that you have silos or other possible causes for those things but you can see here on the slide that we have six different components or elements that are all designed to help avoid an organization ending up with silos the one that is most important for us today are the guiding principles that first one so we'll take a look at those now so these are so another that sorry now that way of a foundation in the it service value system we can take a closer look at those guiding principles and here we have all seven listed focus on value start where you are progress iterative with feedback collaborate and promote visibility think and work holistically keep it simple and practical optimize and automate so let's dive in and take a look at these one by one so that first guiding principle is a focus on value and the the key concept here is that everything the organization does should link back directly indirectly to value for itself its customers and other stakeholders so if the work or activity of the organization isn't delivering value to someone who's a cup who within the organization a customer or stakeholder then you should really question why are we doing this thing there are some very important ideas on how to focus on value they're listed here you know for it value is measured by the customer and the organization i know i've said that before this is gonna be a a very clear theme on how important it is and how we think of value and the way that we measure can be included so it can include but it's not limited to the things that we have on the slide here and organization's employees can only focus on value if they understand what that value looks like for their organization and their customers if you don't have a shared understanding of what is valuable that you're not gonna be able to be successful following this guiding principle i would suggest your organization and services also will not be successful does organization value profit above everything else does it value long term customer relationships or perhaps being seen as an innovator i have talked about how value is not just money but an organization could define value as primarily revenue and then that would be a very important thing to understand for your organization when there's a lot when you in a larger organization value might only be really understood at the senior level i i don't think that's a a good situation but it it's a it is a reality frontline workers may be seen as less important so values and communicate to them that's not a good outcome the guidance in the handbook is that you know if you have a flatter structure with fewer layers of management that can really help align the key concept like value and vision strategies that all employees can work effectively the second guiding principle is to start where you are so in the process of eliminating old unsuccessful methods of service and creating something better there can be a great temptation to remove what has been done in the past and build something completely new this is rarely a wise decision or necessary the handbook goes on to say that this approach can be extremely wasteful not only in terms of time but also in terms of the loss of existing services processes people and tools that could have significant value in the improvement effort do not start over without first considering what is already available to be leveraged so that's the definition from the handbook let's take a look at what this means so if you wanna to start where you are then it's very important to understand where is here if you don't know where you are then you don't know where you're starting and so measurement is particularly critical to this to this principle and it's really important to acknowledge that what and how to measure is a challenge for many organizations now when you're working on the principle of start where you are this could include things like to assess where you are observe current services and methods use measurements to analyze what is being observed and but keep in mind that measuring in effect the result of what is being measured to be successful with this principle service provider organizations need to consider you know being as objective as possible about what your current state is making sure that you're able to analyze current practices and services and decide if they need to continue be replicated or expanded using risk management skills to support decision making and recognizing sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused so this idea of start where you are and don't tear everything down because you wanna build something new that's a very important principle but it also is not the case that you absolutely have to keep everything there are times where it will make the most sense to to start over and build a completely new service i wanna return to the idea of measurement and how important it is not only to measure where we are but also that how we measure needs to be renewed continually to make sure that it continues to be useful are the right people getting right information to make the right decisions and if not how do we fix that i'd like to include something from the ideal handbook that you know some technical organizations are embracing the concept of ob ability so what does that mean well can you ask the right question and can you do it in way that's predictable fast and scalable over time without having to reins instrument or launch new coat so the question is do we have the right measurements in place and that could be human measurements but this is really talking about have we build in things like health checks or other analytics that give us the right information so that when we have questions we have the answers and they're already there we don't necessarily have to add code every time we have in your question the third guiding principle is progress iterative with feedback so resist the temptation to do everything at once it's a great mantra from agile software development stop starting and start finishing so the full definition or the full description of this guiding principle from the handbook is resist the temptation to do everything at once even huge initiatives must be accomplished iterative by organizing working to smaller manageable sections that can be executed and completed in a timely manner the focus on each effort will be sharper and easier to maintain and that's basically a description of agile software development overall so what are the outcomes of feedback so if we're gonna iterate and get feedback so that we can adapt our plan for the next iteration what what does that what happens when you build that into your process well the outcomes of that you're gonna get the an end user and customer perception of value you you're gonna be able to improve the efficiency effectiveness of the services and value chains i'm i'm not gonna read all of these but i will say that to successfully apply this principle you need to consider how do you comprehend the whole but then start doing something and start small and also keep in mind that the ecosystem is always changing and honestly there's kind of ecosystem moving ecosystems so you could think of all the it systems in in your organization as an ecosystem but then there's the larger field of the it industry overall because these things are always changing feedback is essential and going fast doesn't mean that work yeah is allowed to be incomplete iterations may be small but they still have to produce results how do we know if feedback is meaningful accurate well some service provider organizations might dismiss feedback if they feel it represents a dissatisfied minority it's true that tools like customer satisfaction surveys or do you have a higher likelihood of being completed by customers who are very positive very negative but you need to follow things like this the statistical sampling and to and avoid bias sampling techniques so the questions you ask are also very important so let's say we've collected the feedback and we have those outcome what kind of opportunities does this give us well when you ask for feedback and you're able to do it in a clear consistent accurate and fairway way then your organization is gonna be more able to be more flexible responsive to changing requirements because you're gonna shorten the time between the the desire for a changed requirement or change in requirements and you finding out about it you'll also be able to be capable of identifying responding to failures and overall you'll be more quality focused the fourth guiding principles to collaborate and promote visibility this is defined in the it ideal handbook as one initiatives involve the right people in the correct roles efforts benefit from better buy in more relevance because better information is available for decision makers and increased likelihood of long term success so what are the benefits of being of of having visibility that means like making sure that you're sharing what your project is doing and its status and it's assets and things like that and doing it in a way that is accessible and you're not drowning people and too much information but also it's find and when people want it well you're gonna understand what is a priority and what isn't a priority because you're gonna get feedback from your peers but also the stakeholders throughout the organization you're gonna get a better balance of of of work in in daily work you'll understand the flow of a work better you'll understand where bottlenecks are where the where the block of the blocks are in in how your systems are working and you'll also be able to identify where time resources and money are being wasted it's very important to understand that collaboration doesn't just happen on its own the leaders within an organization need to create an environment where a collaboration is invested in where it's valued where it is something that's championed and collaboration can thrive and is rewarded to apply this principle successfully organizations need to consider that collaboration doesn't mean consensus it's not essential that everyone agrees but everyone must understand why decisions are made communication must match the audience and keep in mind different stakeholder groups will lead a different message and communication type that lines up very very tightly with the pm pm box content that we just completed and the good decisions can only be made when there's a visible data to support them now for collaboration to be successful you need high trust and there's the handbook highlights five things good communication support between individuals respect fairness and predictability as the requirements or behaviors that support a high trust organization or a high trust culture taking a look at the fifth guiding principle think and work holistically this is defined as no service practice process department or supplier stands alone the handbook goes on to say that the outputs that the organization delivers to itself its customers and other stakeholders will suffer unless it works in an integrated way to handle activities as a whole rather than separate parts all the organization's activities should be focused on the delivery of value to apply this principle successfully organizations need to make sure that the complexity of this system will affect how this principle is apply because if you higher complexity because higher complexity creates challenges so therefore the collaboration needs to support list of thinking and working automation can support holistic work as well and the patterns and the needs of an interactions between system elements can help identify the holistic viewpoint so as you look at whole systems or the or your entire organization in a holistic way you need to understand you're gonna see higher complexity that probably means that you're gonna need to have more complexity to your solutions so you might not be familiar with the word holistic another way of saying that is focus on the big picture so think about your own role and your teams role in the organization how do you fit into the overall picture what are the dependencies that your team has what teams are dependent on you how do you best collaborate how do you make sure you're communicating across the organization how do you make sure you're not helping build silos you know there's been a lot of focus on functional specialization that means having you know one team focus on one task value streams are divide the task and resources are directed towards completing that task in this near a perfect way as we can so you know think about a fast food or restaurant with one team member makes fries and other makes the burgers and someone else serves the customers this can be really effective but what it does is it also brings the risk that each individual team member might lose sight of the big picture if the team member assembling the burger decides to save time by leaving up the pickles assuming no one likes it or because they don't like it they could create problems for the team member serving the customers who guys deal with the complaints so that little story or that scenario is shared in the handbook to talk about how important is to think about what the end to end service is that goes from the input of we are going to sell hamburgers or there's is demand for for hamburgers and french fries to the output of here is the product with the requirement that we have a satisfied customer and every person in that service chain needs to be invested and be thinking about making sure that the outcome is correct not that i did my part and that's all that matters that kind of thinking is what leads to silos alright guiding principle six keep it simple and practical so this is about always use the minimum number of steps to accomplish an objective outcome based thinking should be used to produce practical solutions that deliver viable outcomes so you can see that tied quite closely to what i was just saying about having making sure that we're focused on outcomes and not the deliverable it's of course important that we have a deliverable but we need to actually deliver the thing that we said that we would but if we ship that deliverable and it does not achieve the outcome for example a happy customer a profitable unit or sale then we're not being successful overall in the devops community there's a term scar tissue that refers to how an organization can develop over time and this means that sometimes an organizational will add extra steps or checked and balances extra pieces of process each time something goes wrong to try to make sure that that same situation never happens again let's look at the example and the ic handbook let's say there's a software patch that was manually tested and then it fails in the live environment so to respond to that an automated test added in a requirement for sign off from a test manager if the patch fails again sign off might also be added from a change manager or the application owner now what happens despite the intention of improving the process is that organizations are adding complexity to how they work that can lead to unintended outcome of employee circumvent the process entirely so this principle is all about don't forget to continually reassess how we work to make things simpler without compromising value anytime you see something that may not serve purpose ask about it see if there's an opportunity to simplify but thinking back to the fast food example don't take a pickle out just because you think it doesn't need to be there we need to keep that big picture in mind so these just as the last guiding principle talk about being holistic and thinking about the organization you need to be they can thinking about these guiding principles and every part of that you bring together because they all have to work together in harmony so it's it's easy to say keep it simple and practical what does that actually look at look like well the handbook has six steps for that and you know briefly ensure value comes from every activity that's a message you've heard several times already recognize that simplicity can be more challenging to create the complexity i definitely agree agree with that there's a famous quote i'm sorry this letter is so long i did not have time to make it shorter it's actually harder to write a short letter than a long letter because you have to really know what you mean you have to condense it down do fewer things and do them better you can't be all things of all people number four respect people's time don't make them do unnecessary work i know we all dislike it when this unnecessary work for ourselves so make sure we're not imposing that or creating systems or processes that will do that to others consider that the simplicity it's considering that simplicity can support quick wins and then lastly remember that processes or services that are easily understand are more likely to be used simplicity is a very important part of usability and usability isn't just something we need to think about for software or apps or things like that but in terms of the systems and processes that we we create to support our work alright last one optimize and automate technology can help organizations to scale up and take on frequent and repetitive tasks allowing human resources to be used for more complex decision making it goes on this is quite a long definition in the handbook it goes on to say organizations must maximize the value of the work carried out by their human and technical resources the four dimensions model provides a holistic way of the various constraints resource types in other areas that should be considered when designing managing or operating an organization technology can help organizations scale up and take on frequent repetitive of the task allowing humans resources to be used for more complex decision making that's the part that i selected to to highlight on the slide however technology should not always be relied upon without the capability of human intervention as automation for automation sake can increase costs and reduce organizational robustness and resilience so you know a lot here let's be really clear on what optimization and automation is so the ideal handbook defines optimization is to make something as effective in useful as it needs to be before an activity can be effectively automated it should be optimized to whatever standard is required sorry that got cut off on the slide so this is i really like the as it needs to be so i've talked about sufficiency before and we want a process to be sufficient we also wanted it to be you know optimized be as simple as possible before we automate this is very important before automating anything you need to really have full discovery you need to know each of the happy paths all of the unhappy paths a potential use cases and make sure that you're able to code or structure the automation to handle all of those situations for the it handbook automation typically refers to the use of technology to perform a step or a series of steps correctly and consistency with limited or no human intervention alright so now that we've taken a look at those two things let's let's look at what optimization activities look like the handbook identifies six of these and they are understanding and agreeing the context for optimization this is making sure that everyone who's involved including your stakeholders has this a shared understanding of what you're doing and why should be optimized you need to understand how it currently is you need to agree on what the future state it's going to be in prioritize focusing on simplification and value ensure stakeholder engagement and commitment if you don't ask for a help sorry if you don't ask if it be helpful and you ship a a a new automation don't be surprised if people don't like it because it's not actually helpful we need to make sure we understand the out the desired outcome and we're focused on that we wanna execute those auto optimization activities iterative i would say you only wanna make one change at the time a process called step wise refinement to make sure that when it your optimization breaks because at some point it will break if you're making sure that you're only iterating with one change at a time you'll very easily be able to identify what caused the brake or what the root cause of the failure was and then last monitoring the impact of the optimization continually to make sure that you that your hypothesis that this is a better way of doing it or a simpler way of doing it is is accurate so there are three automation activities as well focusing on simplification and optimization before automation so that's just like just to see that this is the first part of automation activities which was really two of the activities and optimization tells you how important it is to focus on this idea of simplify and optimize before automation next we need to define the metrics to measure the impact and value that's otherwise we won't know if the automation is successful or not and then lastly use the complementary guiding principles which we've already gone through but the it handbook specifies for complimentary guiding principles progress iterative with feedback keep it simple and practical focus and value in start where you are once a task or process has been introduced and perform regularly the next step often is try to automate it and automation certainly can improve the performance of people and and help processes and streamline the management and organization things it can also improve the way knowledge and information is shared between parts of the organization i also wanna say that you need to really make sure that the full process is understood before you undertake automation so the standard in the it handbook here once a task or process has been introduced and performed regularly but we also wanna make sure that it's fully discovered as well so there are four four standards for automation simplifies the process clarify the process reduce end user contact and don't rush the automate oh don't rush to automate complex tasks so the simplification means that we wanna reduce variation and shouldn't but also should not adversely affect the process outcome removal of necessary information or tasks we'll make the process less useful so there's definitely a trade off process here as in general simplifies for our possible without negative effect and then automate from that point on in terms of clarifying the process before automation this will include process activities task and interactions inputs then you wanna automate a clarify test modify and then automate again being sure to involve all process agents and stakeholders so you can see how important feedback is you want to reduce end user contact with the underlying system and processes if a user were is requesting a workstation for a new starter they should not have to answer an endless list of the questions of what type pc they want how much memory they want or things like that automation with significant end user dependency isn't much of automation at all and then lastly don't rush to automate complex or non routine tasks you wanna really find the things that are simple and high volume first make sure that you're successful with that and keep in mind that not everything is suitable for automation there might be processes that are just too complex not mature enough or just don't happen on often enough to be worth the investment couple of key things with all of these it guiding principles if you're in the different kinds of work styles with waterfall we wanna keep in mind that if a development approach as a linear and sequential and would say predictive in pm with distinct objectives for each phase of the organization everything that we talked about can be used within waterfall for it agile is an umbrella term for a collection of frameworks and techniques but they are ty by collaboration prioritization iterative incremental delivery in time boxing and they recognize a a bunch of different things such as a scrum lead and kanban and then lastly we have the idea of devops which is an organizational culture that aims to improve the flow of value to customers by focusing on culture automation lean measurement and sharing which is often referred to as calms in acronym so these guiding principles remain constant it doesn't matter what works style you're using using these guiding principles allows organizations integrate lots of different ways of working even between different teams in the same organization and still achieve excellence in service management to so with that that wraps up this topic but also all of unit five so i look forward to your questions thanks so much
Unit 5- Topic 1 - Understanding SM.webm: hello and welcome to understanding service management the outcomes for unit five are to be able to scribe the key concepts of service management apply the ethical and professional conduct of service management and describe the guiding principles of service management and this lines up nicely with our three topics key concepts ethics and guiding principles we've completed our work on project management in terms of the instruction which means we are no longer looking at the pm box as one of our resources that's that's complete now so it's very important that you understand that we have a new book that we're looking at now it is also available on o'reilly online learning so nothing to buy and you can have the most recent copy or the addition this is actually quite important there's a very recently released second edition so please make sure that you're looking at this version of the book since the first and second are both available on o'reilly just in case i haven't caught any places where i reference this latest edition please make sure that you're using the link on this slide four unit five we'll be taking a look at chapter one in chapter eight so to get started let's take a look at key concepts of service management we'll begin by exploring the idea of why service management important i'm certain we can all agree as people in the it program but it is important and also an intrinsic part of our lives around the world it's increasingly important that it services or it enabled services are successful and efficient and effective because this is no longer a differentiator for top performing organizations but it's now a requirement to simply survive to make sure that it is able to support the objectives or goals of a business organizations need service management what service management delivers is ensuring that it enabled services achieve the outcomes that business need and not only what they need but when they need it we can see quite a bit of overlap between project management and service management keeping in mind that project management is focused on things that are unique and time limited and service management is ongoing but we'll see many of the same principles and lots of very useful overlap in terms of service management when we have good quality it enabled services organizations are able to meet the needs of their of their customers and of their internal stakeholders as well but it also positions them to be able to innovate and to grow they can take on new strategies and do things like expand existing services or even move into new markets to reflect for a moment on the opposite situation when an organization fails to have good sir good quality it enabled services when they are struggling with poor quality services then they will not be able to deliver what they do on an ongoing basis not even their business as usual sort of work and when you're struggling with that kind of challenge then you're not gonna be able to expand or innovate or offer anything new this is increasingly important as more and more organizations are adopting a strategy focused on digital transformation when that puts it enabled services at the center of their operations so what is it till and when does come where does it come from it used is a similar to pm box and and another an a number of other acronyms that over time sort of get their meaning reframe this used to be the it infrastructure library it that was a body of knowledge for its m information technology service management they've stepped away from those as specific meetings and itunes now just a word but the practice of it and the story of i hill starts in the eighties with the united kingdom government seeking to improve the quality of it services in two thousand there was significant adoption when microsoft used till the develop the microsoft operations framework in two thousand one it version two was released which after that we see a significant increase in ideal certifications this is the time that i was introduced to ide hill at university of wi installed service desk the the help center software by hp owned that service for all of campus and did significant ideal work and went through processes for that such as the change advisory board and things like that in two thousand eight we see ideal version of three is released and at this time there's a move to focus on service life cycles so over that almost thirty year period we can see that is continuing to grow and adapt to the needs of business and i would say becoming more and more sophisticated in twenty nineteen quite recently version four is released and now we have the value system which is a focus of it with integration with devops and ad agile so once again we see the continuing story of it adapt and grow to meet the needs and refined to become more and more refined and i i'm a big proponent and really like what i'm seeing in the latest version of ideal around focusing on value i also really appreciate that they're taking the time to understand the landscape of what's happening in system operations and on are consistently bringing things like devops and agile perspectives to their work so why is it still successful why is it why is it met with the success that it has and how do we know that it's gonna continue to be successful well there are three key reasons for that it's vendor neutral so you don't have to buy products from a particular company it's non prescriptive so this is very similar to what we saw in the pm box that it has a set of best practices but none of them are required to be ideal certified or to say that you run an i an it ideal shop and lastly it's a set of best practices so once again we can see some very strong overlap at in terms of the positioning of both of the pm pm p certification and practices and the it ideal certification it's also really important to to understand that is not academic or theoretical it comes out of the direct experience of its practitioners and it has evolved over many years both in terms of the practice of service management and how they update with new additions of the it ideal standard for example the introduction of the volume system focus in i ideal four now allows organizations to concentrate less on technology and more on how to c value with either internal or external customers that doesn't mean technology is less important but it does mean that we're seeing that how we use technology needs to be more carefully considered and we always have to be asking the question are we creating value with these processes and is it the right value for our organization and for our customers common processes and practices in a strong service management framework all helped to support this focus on value so as we said it till is successful because it's not linked to a single supplier meaning it's vendor neutral organizations can adopt and and adapt the elements of it that work for them and their customers that's non prescriptive in terms of pm p language we would say that you're able to tailor and then lastly it draws in the experience from service management practitioners from around the world and are based on a set of proven activities or processes that have been using multiple organizations that's where we get the practices from it is seen as being preferable to to the proprietary knowledge that can develop inside of an organization in the minds of staff members that's the reason for this is that kind of information or institutional knowledge isn't usually documented in a consistent way it exists because it builds up over time and this means that if potentially is not challenged or improve it can create a real risk if if an experienced staff member leaves in that in that institutional knowledge leaves with them so not only are these three points here part of why it is successful but it also helps provide a common framework for an industry so a comment i would add that is not in the book is it also means that you can go from department to department or even organization to organization and have a common language a common vocabulary in a common set of practices and and processes to successfully manage it systems so let's talk about value and service management these are very important terms so i wanna make sure we spend some time exploring these the it handbook refers to value as the perceived benefits usefulness and importance of something it's important to understand that this idea of value goes beyond then goes beyond the idea of how much is something worth or what is the or or that the only thing that there is a value is money some products and services are more expensive than others but consumers still make the choice to purchase them because they save time or they can pay status so as a service provider organization we always need to understand that what is that what consumers to understand what consumers value about what we offer to them services also need to create value for the service provider to allow them to continue to provide the service in the future so when we look at service management this is a set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services that's a very generic definition and we are definitely gonna see some of those kinds of definitions here in eye i think a little less than pm p because at least an till we know that we're talking about it enabled services as opposed to the pm p content which needs to address all possible industries so when we talk about capabilities this refers to the ability of an organization to carry out our task activity are you able to execute on a plan and get the outcomes that are beneficial or desired the more mature the organization we would expect that its capabilities will be as mature or better than those that are less mature these kinds of capabilities are gonna be based on an organization's experience customers processes service tools markets conditions things like that and as we all know experience grows over time when an organization has lower capabilities you know that would be a time to think about outsourcing and finding an an external vendor to help fill in the gap or train an organization can only develop these kinds of specialized organizational organizational capabilities when it understands three things the first is the nature of value the second is the nature and scope of the stakeholders involved and lastly how value creation is enabled through the services so let's talk a little bit about service management as a professional practice so the handbook wants to spend some time to be sure that they're staking out why service management should be and in fact is a professional practice and that's because there's this extensive body of knowledge experience and skills that has built up over the last forty years as the it industry matured and developed a service focus so service management has developed as it focused has moved from that technology centric approach that we talked about in first iteration of tel that was created in the eighties to an end to end service in value based approach we see this in it tilt version four with the its focus on the customer and quality of servers of the customer receives it is more and more an essential part of what enables our businesses to be successful and it plans need to be aligned with the overall business strategy models and plans ser management has developed as it focus has oh sorry another factor that has contributed to advancement the development of service management is how complex service delivery is becoming more more organizations are using shared services or outsource some or all the it provision to external organizations that might be fully staffed organization it might be a cloud saas hosted service that's white labeled or those kinds of options as the number of stakeholders involved with service delivery increases we need more and more complex and sophisticated service management to control these more and more complex and sophisticated services as our supply chains get more complex we need to make sure that we're adapting service management practices to adapt that situation and that's exactly what we're seeing with it version four the increased complexity of deliberate dove delivery has strengthened improved service management but it also has greater challenges we need to keep that in mind so we're gonna see the term organization come up a lot we're gonna spend just a little bit of time making sure we're crystal clear and what it till thinks of as an organization and that definition is eight so person or a group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities authorities and relationships to achieve its objectives i mean this is one place to see quite a little bit of similarity to a project team except that keep in mind this is for an ongoing continuous continuous service and then this is a very important point organizations facilitate value creation so if if there's an organization or department that isn't creating value we need to ask well why does this exist and maybe there's a very good reason for that but being able to identify the value of each part of our coordinates nation of our larger organization is critical but what does that actually mean in terms of what an organization looks like well let's take a look at this there are four key things that the ic handbook refers to when describing organizations the first is that it can actually be a single person for instance a sole trader within a financial stock team or organization also keep in mind that this definition does not mean that an organization has to be a legal entity it could be a a team that interacts with other teams inside the same legal entities such as the it department providing service to the legal department that would be a team within an organization it could be a legal entity things like a charity or a company any kind of organization a university those kinds of things of course it could also be something like government department or a public sector body so there's you know the two dimensions here you know the size and location within organization but also looking at the kinds of of legal entities that would take on the identity of an organization it's really important that we define this term and understand it so that relationships can be identified and manage and manage for instance some organizations might make expect their it department to behave like an external service provider and transact with the other business departments as customer organizations there might even be internal billing in that kind of situation other businesses defined themselves as a single organization and sees see sees all of their internal departments working together as part of a whole team what's really important here and this is a a consistent message throughout all of p p and on tilt so there's no right or wrong way to structure these relationships they just need to be defined and managed there's also no right or wrong way to do these task but their artists are the best to practices and the more of those best best practices we adopt and use assuming that they're appropriate to the task at hand we would expect those activities to be more and more successful so we've talked about organizations and value let's make sure that we understand how these two ideas intersect because it's quite important the first is that value is a two way relationship that means that we need to make sure that we as an organization we're delivering that that service delivers value to our customer but it also has to deliver value to the organization that two way relationship is very very important because his historically some organizations did not listen to their customers at all they believe that the relationship with the customer was one directional distant and they wouldn't get any feedback they would just simply put out their services and assume that they understood exactly what was needed the the i till handbook is a little bit optimistic here in suggesting that there's no more organizations but but operate that way and i think there's definitely operations that continue to operate that way so the next way that we can think about organizations in value intersecting is that value is c created that's of course dependent on a two way relationship so this idea of c creation implies involvement from both the service provider organization and the consumer so based on the fact that we're seeking a two a relationship and that we wanna c create value in the collaborative way we need to make sure that our that we as an organization as an individual contributor as a team and as an organization that we're gonna listen empathize and respond and that's not just to the customer that's also to our internal stakeholders what's really great is that through the growth of online services we're able to capture so much feedback now and it's quite a a bit more simple easy and cost effective let's look at an example let's imagine soft new piece of software has been sorry let's imagine a new piece of software gets released on an annual basis so every year we ship a a new version but we can make sure that each of those releases are built based on an aggregate set of the feedback and updated requirements we used to do that by aggregate looking at our own data by talking with internal stakeholders but now we can do quite a bit more for instance we could track what buttons customers are clicking what's their dwell time on a particular page where do they log out that where they're midway through a process which is probably a very strong indicator that there's there's a user experience problem and this means that we're able to release software more frequently perhaps even many times a day there's amazon famously talks about our leasing software to thousands of times a day across our organization and this is this is a good example of how you can respond to the feedback that you're monitoring what's really important though is that we put that feedback through the lens of listening emphasizing and then how do we best respond and when when i say best respond what we're looking for is two things how do we respond to the request or the needs of are being articulate articulate by a customer and how do we ensure that the value value we deliver the customer also delivers value to the organization so you know i wanna spend it a little bit more time on this idea of c creation it is quite important so you know c creation focuses on customer experience and an interactive relationship organizations need to collaborate with customers and consumers as well as as well as your suppliers or vendors to offer valuable services any product or service that you were that you deliver is gonna be part of a web or a network of service relationships most organizations act as a customer and a service provider and and as a part of the service delivery you're gonna end buying or selling or consuming and supplying services and service elements for value c creation take place both the the consumer and the service provider must get value from the products are so i've i've repeated that a few times what you should take away from that is how important this idea is to the current version of it so alright that wraps up key concepts of service management
Unit 6 - Topic 1 - SM Roles.webm: welcome to unit six service management practices the outcomes for unit six will be that we explore and discuss service risk management practices such as the roles of service management very specific practices and relationships when you complete this unit you will be able to explain the roles of service management explain service management definitions explain service management relationships in assign roles and responsibilities following service management best practices we have four topics unit unit six roles definitions relationships enroll assignment we continue to be using the ideal four essentials book for unit six you were required to read chapters two three and four please remember to read the second edition and there's the link for the book so let's start off by taking a look at the first topic service management roles so in service these are going to be this is a review of strategic roles of it tail at a very high level and topic six point four we will take a deeper dive into the large set of real world roles that are common in implementations so before we start defining these let's make sure we're aligned on what a role is as from the perspective of it roles are carried out by people and need to be clearly defined so that let those people understand what they're supposed to do not a big prize there pretty straightforward definition i really like that one of course it's very important to make sure we're all clear that clarity around roles and responsibilities is needed for your service management organization to be successful when roles are not clear then tasks may be duplicated or not done at all it's also very important keep in mind that a single person can fulfill many roles also many organizations that are new to high kill and service management look at all of the practices in panic they think they need to hundred hire many people to fill all the roles confusing a job or a person with a role in smaller organizations one person may have lots of roles an it tel does not demand that you hire additional people but it means that we match the roles of service management with the existing team members in your it organization an example could be that a staff member might carry out change enable and configuration management roles service desk might have roles with an incident management access management and request fulfillment but that that's also an example of those more detailed roles that we'll see in topic six point four right now we're going to take a look at those higher level strategic rules the first one is the service provider defined as the organization delivering a service that is the the or the role of of being a service provider a service provider organization must understand who its customers or consumers are and which other stake holders are part of its wider service relationship this very simply put means that service providers need to understand whom they serve who is the service for and how are they being measured it's a a common misunderstanding that it can only be effective or is only suitable for large organizations or certain industries but that's definitely not the this the case all it services a service provider organizations need to have some kind of change enable and the size and type of the organization will definitely influence how change enable is implemented but the reason for having that kind of process you know protecting services while delivering new or updated functionality remains the same so this reminds me of the ability that we talked about with project management that it's important that we ensure that we choose the practices and processes that fit our organization but also that we are open to that are that any organization that has it services could take on ideal practices to improve their outcomes the next role we'll look at is stakeholder define as a personal organization that has an interest or involvement in an organization product service practice or other entity this is another one of these very broad definitions but to be fair i i i can't think of a better way to frame this because that that really is what it is so to go beyond this very generic definition it's important to observe that stakeholders can be anyone inside or outside of the organization and let's keep in mind that if the service provider organization that would typically be the organization that you work for if that organization doesn't understand what its consumers want then they're not gonna have any chance of being able to be successful in delivering services to meet their customers needs that means that organizations have a very strong need to have a a high quality relationship with stakeholders where there's us excellent communication and you're able to really get to understand who they are and what their needs are it's and keep in mind that this term stakeholders chosen because it cons it covers more than just consumers examples of non consumer stakeholders can include suppliers and partners shareholders and investors auditors and employees next we'll take a look at service relationship which is a cooperation between a service provider and a service consumer service relationships include service provision service consumption and service relationship management the reason that this might not sound particularly familiar that it's relatively new language and it's eye hill working very hard at making sure that we're shifting away from framing this kind of interaction as simply making a sale focusing on the two way relationship or two way interactions and identifying it as a relationship i think is a very important step in the right direction so changing our perspective for making a sale to managing a relationship has a significant impact on the decisions we make and how we we behave as a service provider organization to successfully manage service relationships service provider organizations need to continually allocate time and resources after the sale has been made this is critical in understanding why we talk about service relationships because a relationship is ongoing and requires ongoing investment effective service relationship management brings benefit for both the service provider and the consumers together so it's something that's mutually beneficial so let's talk about that consumer role so the consumer is just the personal organization receiving a service but it's it's a very broad term it actually includes the idea of a customer a user and a sponsor and we'll talk a little bit more about that on the next slide it's also important to keep in mind that you know almost all organizations are gonna act as both service providers and consumer service consumers for whatever our organization may sell as a provider we also are a consumer and we buy components or services that we use for our operations or for the production of our product and services as well when you have clear definition of these roles and you're able to have the right understanding on how each of them are different what you're going to get is better communications better relationships and better stakeholder management the roles within the consumer definition can have different and conflicting expectations about value also on a requirements and and what they're willing to pay so it's very important that we un do understand the differences between these roles so let's take a look at those three sub or the three types of consumers and those customer user and sponsor so this isn't particularly complex customers are defined as the role that defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcome of service consumption that's very technical and pretty generic customer here is the one that is the role that identifies needs and measures success and whether those needs are met and then we a user and that's just the role that uses the service so this is very important because you know customer could be a procurement department or even more likely say a finance department just for example and the people who run that department it may not actually use the software or service that's provided so in other parts we might talk in other situations we might talk about a buyer persona versus a user persona for right example so that the users just whoever actually uses it and sometimes that's a pure support relationship and you know they don't pay us or anything like that that that's very common lastly we have a a consumer sponsor and that's the role that authorizes budget for service consumption can also be used to describe an organization or individual that provides financial or other support for an initiative so this gets a little bit fuzzy because you know all three of these roles could be a single person if depending on the organization but it's important to keep the concepts of these different types of consumers separate i also wanna make sure that we're taking a look at the different value for different stakeholders i'm not gonna read this entire list but i will say that take a look at the different kinds of stakeholders i really like that it talks about society and community overall and charity organizations but as you think about it stakeholders how each of these different kinds of stakeholders measures value is different and is important to understand in terms of how do we how are how do we manage their expectations and how do we measure success for them and how do we make sure that we're delivering the right kind of value for them we talked about ra responsible accountable consulted informed previously in pm p it till also talks about it so i'm spending more time on racing now to give a little deeper of a dive in part because i it's strongly included in the it material but this is a very good example of overlap between the project management and service management work so i think it's worthwhile to have a little extra time on this so just to remind you the ra model is used to track who is doing what but it also provides a a clear shared map of roles across the different teams in the organizational structure racing models are used to manage resources and roles for the delivery of work or a given task but typically at the service level for service management resources can be included from different functional errors within an organization which is a very good thing to do in terms of organizational efficiency but it can make it challenging for line managers to track what their staff are doing and to whom they're reporting sometimes it's called a a matrix management model so let's just remind ourselves on what each of the states of ra are how are they're defined and we'll start with accountable because only one person can be accountable for any task this is the person who has overall authority for the task but they may not carry out individual pieces of work themselves they're i'm not saying they're forbidden i'm saying that it's possible that they're simply accountable and they delegate all of the work any number of people can be responsible for the work as part of the way c model these are the contributors who will actually get the tasks done and they report to the inc resource about their progress consulted resources who need to be referred to to get a task done this might be a person within the organization who has a specific set of knowledge or experience it could be a document store or even internet search engine these resources need to be tracked to ensure they're available when required and then lastly is informed these are stakeholders who need to track and understand exactly how the task is proceeding or they may need an output from the task business sponsors for example will typically be informed at progress as part of a project or service so that goes over the the idea of ra and defines each of the four states or four roles it's very common to express ra as a matrix if you wanna do that the recommended process is to first identify what the activities are then identify the roles then you need to assign the ra codes for each role which could be a team or a person then we need to make sure to do some quality assurance so we identify any gaps or overlap and then lastly we distribute the matrix for feedback and then once we have agreement on it then we ensure that we monitor this is in pm p language or this would be a control step to ensure that we're actually doing the work as needed so this is an example i got this from the digital project manager site which i like quite a bit and this takes a look at lord of the rings as a ra chart so you know that first step is identify the tasks decide what to do with the ring create fellowship get the ring amount doom distract and defeat enemies then we identify who the different roles are so frodo sam gandalf ara and elrond and then we assign the ra code each of them you can see that there's no gaps or overlap here so we're all set so we're ready to start the the the march from r to to mount doom and as we go we'll monitor to make sure that as we go along everyone is is consulted informed of responsible or accountable as we need and that's it for the first topic service management roles
Unit 6 - Topic 2 - SM Definitions.webm: next we'll take a look at unit six point two service management definitions understanding the ideal concept of services is critical to successful service management and to do that properly we need to understand the different terms and aspects that it defines around services and that's what we have here in the book you'll see list is several from different things listed in terms of these all about services but in the actual content it deals with four pairs of things so that's i'm following that strategy here so products and services outcomes and and outputs and outcomes cost and risk utility and warranty let's get started with products and services so we have a couple of definitions here the first one is that a product as a configuration of an organization's resources designed to offer value for a consumer that's a really good definition it's quite broad and vague covers a lot of does lot covers a lot of options but i i think it's pretty straightforward the second one is a little bit more complex but you know it's trying to just grab a very difficult or challenging concept a service is a means of enabling value c creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks so the other way to think about this is that selling a service is selling convenience so whether it's a a meal service that ships ingredients to your house to cook or whether it's a email for your company in both those situations what you're doing is you're paying for the outcome or the output to the email service or the the dinner ready to cook for for yourself and you don't have to manage any of the specific costs the the ingredients or the server licenses or anything like that or any of the risks making sure that things are safely prepared for the food or making sure that email servers are patched and and safe to use the service definition is more complicated but i think ultimately it it is a a quite a good definition if somewhat un so really important to see that product is you know created from resource is so let's get a better understanding of what those resources are so the it ideal handbook references to these things people information technology value stream streams processes suppliers and partners so the services and organization provides based on one or more products and products are con from the configurations of the resources to which an organization has access so to put that altogether for it services sell convenience so that an end user consumer doesn't have to bear the direct cost or risk of that service in services are based on one or more products and that products are created from the resources of the organization which are the different things listed on this slide so how do we know what the value of a product is well there's a a number of ways to measure that cost risk outputs outcomes utility and warranty all important dimensions of services overall that's actually the remainder of this unit covers these things but it's important to see how interconnected these things are and how these directly relate to understanding product value it's also very important that a service provider organization consider all of these things in total and how they balance when they're evaluating the the attractiveness of their server of their services let us take the example of free online banking that might be attractive to customers but if it's insecure and risky the it will not be successful another example would be free one hour delivery of items ordered on an online shopping site or app could also be very attractive but if it's very high cost the organization that won't be able to manage it either because customers will not want to pay that much or it won't be profitable if for the organization i think that's a particularly good example because that talks about the c creation of value value has to be there for both the consumer and the service provider organization products and services need to be considered holistically if you focus on any one of these elements that you're gonna miss the big picture and the customer doesn't get the outcome they wanted successful services built with successful products have the right mix and balance of these different elements altogether let's take a look next at outputs and outcomes the it handbook defines outputs as an as a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity so that word deliverable it's something we've definitely heard before with project management and an outcome is the result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs so this is a this is actually a very clean definition and i i like this a lot what's really important is that people come to an organization they they buy a product or a service for the outcome not for the output now the outcome is the result of something that's enabled by an output so you don't get one without the other but it's very important that if you ship in an output if you if if you provide a deliverable but it doesn't meet the outcome then you're not gonna be successful so what sorry more to say here when we have the right outputs consumers can achieve their desired outcome and that's another example of c creation without input or activity for the consumer no value is created so we need to know what the outcomes are that our customers want so that we're able to make sure our outputs are aligned with that and then value is created when a service has more positive than negative effect so this is a very important statement i'm gonna say that again value is created when a service has more positive than negative effect please be clear that a service could have and almost always will have some negative effects now there's no perfect solution there's no perfect system every decision every product every service is made on a basis of trade offs this for that we can't be all things to everyone so for example it might cost to consumer money to pay for that external email service as we've mentioned but it could reduce the amount of money the consumer spends on internal resources and transfers the risks associated with hardware failure or patch up updates or a mis delivered mail to another organization that's the kind of thing we mean with those kinds of trade offs i mean what are the negative effects in that example well it might take longer to make an admin a server based or system then change if i wanna map some new aliases or if there's a new spam filter i wanna apply if it's in house then i'm able to align my resources or prioritize my resources to say hey team email team my it team i need to make these changes right now it's urgent if you're using that external company then you're gonna be in a queue and your needs will be prioritized against the the sla the service level agreement that you've paid for so that's an example of that is positive and negative effects with these kinds of products and services that we're talking about in and that value is created when a service as more positive than negative effects so this diagram comes from the book and it shows the balance between costs and risks removed or introduced by the services so as long as the overall value has the right balance for the customer for instance if the supported outcome the costs removed and the risks removed outweigh the affected outcomes the cost introduced and the risk introduced by the service then then that's how we know we've achieved value the service provider needs to understand the cost of how much the cost of the cost of provisioning the service to make sure that they're within the budget constraints to make sure the the to make sure the service is profitable for the organization now to be clear profitable doesn't mean that there's money on the table for example a public sector organization or not for profit might be required to meet budget targets rather than generate profit alright next let's look at cost and risk i told fines cost as the amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource risk is a possible event that could cause harm or loss or make it difficult to achieve objectives love these definitions very clear very simple very straightforward risk can also be defined as uncertainty of outcome and can be using the contest of measuring the probability of positive outcomes as well as negative outcomes so it's i like that they continue to to have a more nuanced understanding that risk is not only but what is possible but also measuring what is probable we also need to think about risk as not only being what is going happening in terms of what could happen but also how severe is the that potential negative outcome something very important to to think about there as well service provider organizations need to manage the detail of risk on behalf of consumers this is a very significant part of why servers providers are able to deliver value to consumers because they manage all of the risks so that the consumer doesn't have to be worried about it this ultimately could be seen as convenience but it's a also a very significant source of value the consumer you know takes part in risk reduction by helping find the service what it needs to do providing the requirements so that the service provider is able to have the right scope of the service and understand where can put in the right constraints so that the service can be safe and they minimize risks so one example that we could look think about as an online file storage service there's a bunch of different security options that you could offer from just sort of minimal security maybe just password to full encryption and multi factor authentication based on the needs of the consumer and how important password the data is or how risk ave diverse they are to a data breach you know we'll set the kind of requirements for that service and the more complexity of those were con requirements then naturally the greater the cost for the service provider so the likely the where of the fee for the consumer so the consumer's attitude to risk must be well understood for the service to be designed appropriately so that this customer stakeholders will get the right value out of the service next we'll talk about utility and warranty the so utility here is defined as functionality offered by a product or a service to meet a particular need another nice very simple next we've warranties the assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements so this is you know that's i i already mentioned sla or service level of agreement or uptime requirements things like that those are common concepts or examples rather of warranty and it services so a service provider assess the utility warning of a service to ensure that's gonna create the right value for the customer so you know that utility it just describes what does the service do and is it fit for the purpose of the customer needs or this particular customer it's relatively rare that a service will be created for a single customer most often an organization will create an inventory of services to be sold many times so wanna make sure that there's a good customer fit for the service and when you're going through that sales process at the beginning of that service relationship this describes what the service does and you know a service can provide utility by removing constraints from the consumer or supporting the performance or both warranty describes just how well the service performs and once again does it fit the needs of the consumer so that warned he describes how the service performs and covers areas like availability capacity security and continuity and the service must must meet the levels required by the customer if it's gonna generate the right value for for both sides cost risk utility warranty all provide a picture of a services viability or how how well it's gonna perform overall let's take a look look at an example for utility and warranty imagine we're creating a social media platform and so the utility would be like a list of features so for instance a lot the the social media platform allows users to to create or rather to follow other accounts that they're interested in another feature would be that allows users to decide if they wanna see the most recent or the most popular content so the what kind of algorithm are we using to present new new items on the user's feed and then the last hypothetical feature that we'll consider here for the social media platform example is allowing users to block accounts with which they don't want to interact anymore alright so what does that mean the warranty side well the platform has to be available when users want it for example it can't fail just because of high traffic today that probably means that you're north of ninety nine point nine percent uptime for for a social media platform to be successful probably even higher than that actually availability is very important and when you have when you scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of users you're pretty much guaranteed to always have a large number of users be active or have concurrent sessions twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days of the year we need to make sure the platform keeps users details secure so that your privacy is protected then the last example of a warranty here would be the platform could be restored if there were a major issue so that you have not only do you have good continuity of of service and that if there is a major interruption you're back up quickly but also that you're able to restore so there's a minimal amount hopefully no data but a minimal amount of data loss in that situation and that wraps up service managed definitions unit six point two
Unit 6 - Topic 3 - Service Relationship.webm: and we'll conclude unit six by taking a look at service management relationships in this topic we'll look at two key things service offerings and service relationships so let's get started with service relationships these are defined as a description of one or more services designed to address the needs of a target consumer group these services can offer goods access to resources and service actions so let's take a look at what those three things are goods are defined as the kind of thing where when ownership is transferred to the consumer for example when you buy a car one of the key things to distinguish a good from a service is that with a good consumers take responsibility for the future use of that good so this example of a car will be useful throughout all three of these description so let's next take a look at access to resources with access to resources the ownership is not transferred but the consumer still has access or the benefit of that product for example renting a car i think another very good example would be any subscription service such as spotify or netflix where you get the benefit of the product of the music or of the the different shows and movies but you don't own them in this model access is granted or licensed and there are terms and conditions so for example with the the car rental or a car lease example we might see that you have a limit to the number of kilometers you can drive or where you can go maybe you are limited from leaving the province or the country during the term of the rental with subscription services online subscription services we can see things like and the number of simultaneous screens or the maximum resolution of the picture as being additional access to resources that could go beyond and then lastly we have service actions service actions are performed by the provider and what they do is they fulfill some sort of need on the consumer it sounds a lot like service offerings overall but there's a very particular way of thinking about these and that's because they're post sale so for example roadside assistance if a car breaks down would be a good example service actions are performed as part of the agreement with the consumer so if you paid extra and had guaranteed assistance with one hour that would be an example or if you paid for additional training services or live support for a service and it service would be other examples it's very important to keep in mind that the consumer group to which a service is offered can very well be part of the same organization as the service provider or as the provider group but i'd also that but that does means sorry that's the provide that the consumer group it can't be an external organization as well like it can be both what with modern it departments very frequently they are structured to interact with the other departments of the same organization essentially as customers with billing and hourly rates and things like that so this is a very important concept for us in this course it's also important when we talk about service offerings to make sure that we're clear that a service provider can offer the same product in different ways to different from consumer groups so if we wanna look at that car example again there could be short term or long term car leases or at least with a right to buy at the end of police we could also look at different tiers of subscription services often where there's a free solo account a small team account a large account in an enterprise and with each of those tiers the cost is more and more overall although the per unit price per user might be lower and the the benefits the different features of the product or the service are increased as well that is service offering so let's shift our attention now to service relationships here we have them defined as a cooperation between a service provider and a service consumer service relationships include service provision service consumption and service relationship management and we'll be looking at those three things as our lens for understanding service relationships so we have three technical definitions in our it tail handbook here so i'm actually gonna read those here so i wanna make sure that we're level setting with with the correct precise definition so first let's look at service provision service provision is defined as activities performed by an organization to provide services this includes management of resources configured to deliver the service access to these resources for users fulfillment of agreed service actions service performance sorry service performance management a continual improvement it may also include supply of goods so this is really about providing provisioning providing the service to the customer and everything that that entails you can see some language here about continual improvement about sir service performance management also making sure that you're fulfilling the agreement interestingly you can also include the supply of goods so what if we had a online printer service that you were able to connect to the cloud and print to any number of your any number of printers throughout your organization and it'll manage the queue and permissions and things like that it could also automatically provide the supply of ink or toner and it could ship those on the basis of need by monitoring the levels in in each printer so there would be one example of how you might see an it service have have a provision that has both a service a digital service and a supply of goods service consumption is defined as activities performed by an organization to consume services this includes the management of the customer's resources needed to use the service service use actions performed by the users and may include receiving acquiring goods so this is very much the other side of the equation of service provision or the service provider the service consumer does service consumption which really just means using the service and gaining the benefit that that was paid for alright so let's take a look at service relationship management this is defined as including joint activities performed by a service provider and a service consumer to ensure continual value c creation based on agreed and available service offerings so that's a big mouthful it's a highly technical and i don't think it does a a a great job of helping shed light on what they mean by in fact i think the the term service relationship management is more is just sufficiently clear on its own but if we think about as the equation and on one side of the service provision and on the other way of the service consumption the service relationship management is what connects the two and ensures that both parties or both organizations are receiving adequate value on the one hand by the consumer for the benefit of the product or service and on the other hand on the provider in terms of it being profitable for them to deliver the service alright so given that let's let's take a look at what this looks laid out in a model i think that could help us better understand what we see here so here this diagram comes from the textbook and we have resources that then feed into products those products can be delivered as goods access to resources or service actions that is the service offerings that can be sold to a customer and then at the end once we have a service provider and a service customer we're then able to engage in a service relationship so you could use this model to map some of your own organization services or us a a team that you've been part of in the past and assess how they're offered to consumers what i'm gonna do next is i'm gonna walk through this using our social media platform example from the previous unit let's take a look what would we have here for social social media platform for resources i want you to think about that for a moment what i would put here is compute and data so all of the hosting the networking the bandwidth went the or all of that kind of stuff all the infrastructure to actually run the social media platform but also all of the data the content of each post the metadata about who the users are their demographic information location frequency time of posting all those kinds of things together so then on top of those resources our social media platform company can build some products and that might feel like there's just a single product but if you look at any mature social media platform you'll notice that they have many many products as a matter of fact to start off with they have products or different platforms or operating systems macos os windows ios android but also within them they have different products so you could see things events or donations groups chat all those kinds of things but beyond that we can also see how they diversify their product offering through different by appealing to different audiences so for example a low bandwidth light version kids version or even an enterprise version we could see a kids version with youtube kids and we could see an enterprise version with facebook work alright so then let's look at what those actually mean in terms of product products or how those products are offered well let's take a look at goods is that our physical good well i think probably not although an app might fit keep in mind that the litmus test for a good is that the consumers responsible for taking care of it once delivered now also they may not paid for a freemium model where the app itself is made available at no cost is very common so i'm not quite sure how that fits certainly the idea of goods fits much easier in the analog world than the digital world let's talk about access to resources well access to resources it could be i think most clearly the the audience on their platform to sell to advertisers let's keep in mind that in the social media world typically your customer is gonna be somebody who wants to sell advertising which really makes the the users the product doesn't meet make them unimportant you have to keep both of those very happy you need to have a the correct relationship or a functioning relationship but positive one with both your customers who are paying you to advertise but if you don't have a sufficiently positive experience for the users and they'll leave your platform and you won't have anything to sell in terms of service act what could we see here i think maybe something like boosting posts we could also see training certification and an advertising account executive to manage higher dollar customers and make sure that they're happy and you retain them but potentially even managing a social media account i i don't think i know of any large organization that that does that but there's lots of third parties that do it wouldn't stretch the imagination to see that they could bring that in house if they wanted i think it's also really important to to make sure that we spend oh that we spend some time focused on the relationship part of this so in terms of so the service offering overall is going to be just the social media platform in its entirety so what what do we what do we need to think about on the service relationship well let's stay focused on the advertisers we're have to make sure that there's a an easy way to know that your ads are being effective you need able track the the data so you know that your spend is effective so there's a whole world of social media platforms that most users never even see on the back end that's designed just for the advertisers so you can understand how to target your advertisements and and be able to measure their effectiveness but we also have to see the service relationship to the users this is something we might call a two sided marketplace and i wanna get too far into that but you know the facebook and twitter and all those other kinds of social media platforms need to have a large number of daily active users who are highly engaged to create the opportunity to sell advertising to those to those users who will then view the ads and click on them that means they need to have enough value and they need to have a positive experience to remain engaged if i don't if you were trying to find help for face book or twitter but you'll notice it's pretty much self serve and you gotta just find the answer and sometimes the answer isn't even provided by the organization but by somebody posting on a help group or something like that it would be very hard to provide strong support to a billion users or more so i think that's important to consider i think if you look at what the help features are for the paying customers you'll see a very different kind of experience where there's help desks and live chat perhaps even the account executive you could talk to that's all part of the service relationship and understanding how valuable each stakeholder is and making sure that each stakeholder gets sufficient value to remain engaged in part of your product okay so let's take a look now at this service relationship model i wanna be very clear that this is a simplified example it's also presented in a very linear and sequential of way and that's not necessarily how you get see this in the real world these relationships are not in any way required to be structured in the way as illustrated here however it's a very nice clean diagram for us have a conversation about so i think it's great this comes from our textbook as well so in this figure we have a series of organizations and we have that that they obtain and configure some kind of product or service and then they offer and provide that service to a downstream organization moment that could loop back definitely so but let's take a look at organization a here and for this example we're gonna say that they produce processors computer processors and organization b builds laptops and organization a is a supplier to organization b and we can see that it is in this connection which between the provision and the consumption of the service that we have the opportunity for a service relationship and so as each of these steps go this is where we can see the the connection between them and understand how that they this all connects as an entire model also notice that organization a isn't con processes they have to get raw materials and hire engineers and make sure their factory runs and all kinds of things so from organization a we have pros those pros processors get sold the organization b b makes laptops and sells it to it an organization it department right here and once again we have that service relationship now organization c is going to provide these laptops to the consulting department but what in this story the organization c and d are actually inside of a single organization i wanted to come back to the idea of how these organizations don't have to all be external so what we have here is a supply and chain of supply and consumption but remember that for most organization supply consumption is more complex is a more complex network of relationships than we're seeing here i also like to point out that we have a service relationship going off to something downstream so in this in this scenario we talked about this being it i's consulting team so this would be some sort of relationship with an external organization potentially where they're providing that consultation services that they're you know using those computers for now interestingly i i talk about how this could be more complex you organization b could in fact sell those laptops back to organization a to help them build their processor and that's the kind of complex that complexity or messi ness that we're talking about and that is service relationship model so that wraps up unit six for us so please let us know let me know if you have any questions looking forward to seeing those on ms teams or on discussions
Unit 7 - 4 Dimensions of SM - Topic 3.webm: next we'll take a look at topic three partners and suppliers here we have a definition once again in from the guy from the from the tool guide to state about partners and suppliers encompass in organization's relationship with other organizations it goes on to say because that's a little bit too broad but it's quite long other organizations that are involved in the design development deployment delivery support and or continual improvement or of services so we could say that partners and suppliers are those organizations that wrote that those relationships that an organization has with other organizations related to they're delivering their services it also incorporates contracts and other agreements between the organization and its partners and the suppliers it's important to understand that this scope of what this dimension includes is service provider and service consumer relationships an organization's partner and supplier strategy factors that influence supplier strategy and also si service integration and management supplier and partner relationships can come in many different forms they could be as simple as a commodity service paying for hydro paying for electricity or paying for internet bandwidth to complex partnerships with shared goals and risks so for example if you have an it service that is cloud based and has an api working with a third party to provide a service on top of yours that they resell and you revenue share that would be an example of a more complex relationship very very few organizations operate independently of anyone else and use no services from other organizations so let's let's talk a little bit about external suppliers so the reason this is so important is that one part of it service management one part of it could be focused on on managing suppliers you could be doing a sell through as a as a value added reseller or as a managed services organization you might buy a service then that you then resell something like a security audit or i network monitoring penetration testing those are all examples that come to mind for me what's very important here is like the your organization keep the outcome as the focus and to keep in mind that price is not the only way of measuring value so to build on that the significance of external suppliers in service delivery can you have a really significant impact on what skills you as an its m might need that's because instead of you know building that from scratch you might be involved with contract negotiation and agreement so this is a pretty classic case of a buy versus build decision an organization doesn't have to build everything sometimes it's much more efficient and much more profitable to simply buy it and then resell it or include it in your offering so instead of conducting the activities of building a service and then managing something in house it's very possible to be overseeing a supplier and managing that ongoing relationship that could create some problems or commercial issues could arise from that if a supply if the supplier you choose the peep sorry the people who choose your that supplier have little or insufficient contact with the product or or the service teams even more importantly is whoever did makes the decision on that service needs to understand the needs of the user and that's when i what i mean by keep the outcome as the focus the outcome isn't to deliver the service the outcome is to deliver value to the end user that's why value is such an important part of everything that we're talking about in it and in fact in project management as well a procurement team might end up being driven more by price than anything else which means that you might get a very competitively priced service but it could also mean that you will not meeting the needs or not delivering sufficient value to your customer that's why on the slide i highlight that price is not the only way of measuring value up but of course it definitely is one way you don't want to be over charged for those services either in it service management professional needs to be able to work across silos such as for instance it support networking and procurement to make sure the contract of meets the needs internally and externally and we'll deliver the desired outcome for the customer so this section talks about supplier strategy factors you know some places look at different ways of managing their supplier strategy there's quite a few options listed here but this is a complex topic so what is your strategic focus what is your corporate culture around supplier strategy what is the current state of resource scarcity what are your cost concerns which is another way saying how much can you spend or how constrained are you on budget what is the internal expertise what are the external constraints and what are the demand patterns so this isn't the language so this is sorry this slide is very much the language of the it ideal guide but what i would like to to focus on here or suggest as a parallel way of thinking about it which wouldn't be particularly helpful if you were taking the exam i'd like to put this back into the buy versus build decision because all of these are asking the question should we lead be building things are cells or should we be buying a service then then that we then we sell so taking a look at strategic focus the it guide that talks about how some organizations are are very interested in being self sufficient whereas others are very quick to outsource non core work so understanding where your organization is on that spectrum is very important what is the core what is the cultural bias of your corporate culture or organizational culture in terms of your sourcing decisions has there been a history of a bad outcome that is pre exposing the organization to reject a by option or using a supplier that's using the language of the the it guide that maybe isn't accurate or necessary taking a look at resource scarcity some resources and skills are very hard to find so if you just can't hire them as a as an employee maybe you need to outsource it to an agency or another organization because they have the capacity it to take on the work and you are unable to bring it inside of inside of the walls so to speak what are the cost concerns and this is a a huge part of buy versus build is it cheaper to source the service externally for instance you go to aws they or they have all the investment for twenty four seven monitoring uptime and all kinds of red it's a lot cheaper because they figured out how to scale that over a large market then running that kind of data center yourself either on or what about subject matter expertise you can't possibly have every person who knows everything within your organization and one advantage of working with the suppliers that they can bring deep expertise that the organization does not and cannot build internally at least not on the short term it's pretty close to resource scarcity but expert expertise is a lot more around a consulting or experience where resource security scarcity might be something like a hadoop developer during the early introduction of hadoop or or something like that what are the external constraints is something else that we need to look at here what is there any relevant legislation or regulation that can affect our sourcing decisions that could be something like the requirement to keep things onshore and without going to a foreign a jurisdiction do we have to have a certain number of auditors on on staff for a particular thing for a particular legal requirement do we have to make sure that that matches our revenue or a number of customers or something and then lastly the last factor in that the ic guide talks about for supplier strategy is demand patterns do we have seasonal staff to provide extra support say during a holiday shopping period or i come out of an ed tech background september august september is a huge spike in resources both in terms of our infrastructure but also actual support help to ramp up a huge number of schools all getting on board at the same time and then demand patterns can also help in other ways i've worked for an organization that has that had it support resources in the eastern time zone then in the central australian time zone and what that did is give us an exact twelve hour offset which means each each office or each region was able to manage twelve hours of of support and hand it off which gave us a really great way to manage the demand patterns of local ti and but also provide twenty four seven for all customers regardless of where they were located not exactly a supplier strategy that last example but for instance if you outsource that help desk resources that having them operate in the opposite twelve hours of your normal business would be one way to take that same model and apply it to a supplier scenario so let's take a look at what the it guide talks about service integration and management so i like this idea i think it's important that we we consider this i don't like this diagram i don't think it's particularly helpful but hey it's it's what's in that book so you know but the reason for si am i think some people say sam but i i probably say si am is that as you have an increasing number of suppliers the entire supplier management process can get get can get quite complex so when you have say in internal service providers and external service providers you could use si s i i as a management methodology with that center on the idea of the service integrator role to coordinate servers relationships regardless of who the suppliers so this would be a single person it doesn't have to be a full time role but if you're growing into this but i certainly can see in a large organization this can be a team of people as a matter of fact that are responsible for all service integration and management carried by any one of the organization and they're the the primary liaison for any external organization that's providing service the particular advantage of this is that it gives you a single point of contact and that single point of contact has a three sixty degree view or complete view of all the service integrations whether they're internal or external this is a really great way to help get out of that siloed model and this would definitely when we think about the different organizations this definitely would not be or regional it's kind of not even functional because these services could be for finance or for code or for hr or for whatever probably more like an infrastructure team something this would very likely be part of and report up to the it leadership and it organization and help provide that that consistency and visibility to adequately and successfully manage all these different services regardless of whether their internal external and for which department they're providing a service for and whether they're providing a service for us internally or for our end user which is really important and that is topic three
Unit 7 - 4 Dimesions of SM - Topic 1.webm: next we'll take at take a look at the first dimension organization and people now usually here i take a look at the definition and the guide doesn't really cover a definition i'll i'll go over what it says so instead i have a coke here a just for me is that an organization can only be as good as its people certainly when we come together we're gonna achieve more together but if you don't have good culture and great people and the right structures in place then you're not gonna be able to succeed now you could have great people and bad organization and you're still not gonna get to where you need to be in terms of being a successful organizations of both of these things need to come together and that's what this dimension is all about so in terms of what the leading information or the definition that they provide what our guide says is that the complexity of organization is growing and it is important to ensure that the way an organization is structured and managed as well as its role responsibilities and systems of authority communication is well designed well defined and supports its overall strategy in an operating model that seems like a pretty straightforward position it's a a long and complex sentence but basically it's saying that you know our organizations are getting more and more complicated and if if your organization isn't structured and managed properly in a way that is well defined and supports its strategy then you're not going to be able to be successful so what does the guides say what does it think about defining organization and people well it talks about four key aspects formal organizational structure culture required staffing and skills and roles and responsibilities the guy doesn't go too much detail here but i think it's really important to understand that formal organizational structures are how is your actual organization structured what are your how what is the idea behind your departments you have sales and marketing is it functional or is it something else so talk a little bit more about that throughout the course so far i i've touched on the importance of culture many many times and it's really important that we have a a positive culture that's championed by leadership that is accepting and supportive that and that doesn't just mean that we we're nice and treat everyone with kid gloves that also means having the right performance conversation of making sure that the standards and acceptable behaviors is of the organization are are maintained with clear and respectful conversations we required staffing and skills we we have to have the right people on the team with the right capabilities to get the job done that needs to get done if we don't have people with the skills to manage our servers or a network then we're not gonna be able to build anything on top of those but that doesn't just mean technical skills it also means leadership and management skills and everything in between often that means that you might have to train up people in your organization or hire in new team members with those capabilities experiences or skills lastly we need to have a very clear understanding what roles are within the organization what the roles are within each department or or subunit we also understand the roles responsibilities of those different organizations and once we have that then we can make sure that we can do not only understand the right accountability for who is supposed to be doing what and that's not to place blame but when we're doing a root cause analysis that is part of understanding how we arrived to an outcome that was not desires they'll can do better next time but the other important things that you can do a gap analysis and see if there are any gaps in your roles or responsibilities to let's take a look at understanding organization in people so a number of very interesting things in the book here again not a lot of detail and i presented this as a cycle or as a sequence it's not presented like that in the book but i think if you look at it i i think that they put a lot of thought into the order i i think there is something cyclical or systemic about what they're presenting so we need to think about what is the management and leadership dial of the organization and that's at the top of the of the the diagram here who's presented first in the guide and i really like the the that that that they lead with that i think it's a very important thing that we understand the management and leadership style is going to perm the entire organization i we need to make sure people have the right skills it's a a well documented well research fact that people typically don't leave companies or jobs they leave managers and the core competencies of a manager to retain people as much as possible is to make sure that the that their reports that their team members know what they're supposed to do and have the tools to do it and one of an an exceedingly key part of the tools to be able to accomplish one's job is the skills and competencies the the expertise to be do it and if you don't have it especially if the job position is evolving or there's new project work or new service work and ensuring that we're training up our team members to be ready for that and setting them up for success is very important communication and collaboration is of course critical we've talked a lot about communication and collaboration particularly in the project management sign of the course equally important here with service management we need to have broad knowledge plus deep specialization not not everyone needs to know everything but service in the service organization people would really benefit from knowing a little bit about lots of things but we also need to know who the experts are so we can go to them when we have of a a very complex or if a sophisticated problem common objectives this would be another way of talking about strategy of if we're not all pad the same direction if we're not spending our calories to move the organization in the same direction then we're gonna be wasting a lot of time energy and money so having common objectives are very important and that is tightly tied the idea of common objectives are tightly tied to communication and collaboration because the way you achieve common objectives is by having high performing or effective and efficient communication and collaboration and the last thing they have here which i really like is the idea of breaking down silos as you have larger and larger organizations and this action started off talking about the increasing complexity of organizations that's how you create silos that's a pretty natural thing to happen but we would need to make sure that we don't isolate our team and operate out of contacts or out of sync with the rest of the organization but and then we come back to that of management and leadership style so it's important that management and leadership throughout the organization support all of these different aspects and they that you're able to get people aligned and working in the same direction on these particular cultural pieces but also living these values with each project or each service so let's talk a little bit about cultural considerations i'm very happy with what's in the guide on this five different things to talk about here i really appreciate start with trust and in my experience people can think of at least two kinds of trust and the kind of trust we're looking for is to trust that other people are acting in good faith and that we will come to them with a question when when things aren't meeting our expectation the other kind of trust i've seen model isn't so great and that's when you say well i trust that that he or she's an idiot or that they don't know what they're doing and you'll use that as your model of trust and make those kinds of assumptions and that's definitely not what we're talking about we're talking about that positive trust that leads to collaboration next we have transparency it's is very important we don't keep secrets and we don't hide things now when you're in management and there are certain times where discretion is important though perhaps for professional reasons management reasons privacy reasons and certainly there's lots of proprietary or trade secret information and that's not what we're talking about but when we work with our colleagues we need to be highly transparent about what's happening and not withhold information from them or our motivations or intent next are collaboration and share values very nice to put these two things together i think collaboration is a shared value or needs to be a shared value but also the ideas of the values of your organization and then each team each department each organization can often have its own values as well but making sure that you're there to work with each other this is the particularly important with that idea of breaking down silos if we're not we don't have shared values and we're not willing when to collaborate then breaking down silos will be a non starter you're never gonna get there so this is this next one's actually my favorite one leaders who champion values so very much leadership and that doesn't mean the c suite so just the ceo or the president it means every manager every director every team lead every individual contributor who acts as a leader through individual leadership in meetings and in the break room and like us on zoom calls and all kinds of things but the leaders championed the values and that means supporting people and acknowledging and gets celebrating when people live those values especially when it's hard or especially when it's risky but also stand up in celebrating acknowledge when people aren't living those values or when decisions have been made or their activities which don't correspond to those values in that case the leaders need to be able to speak up and talk about that as well the last one that we have here is coordination of course we we have to coordinate and this is a little bit different than collaboration in so far as collaborations more about between people and for me the way i look at coordination is more between teams and departments especially the larger the organization the more important coordination can be alright let's look at organizational structure so here we have three key kinds of organizational structure well sorry two key kinds of of of structure and then the midst or the hybrid one the first one is functional we talked about this a little bit at the beginning of the topic and this could be things like sales customer service and finance so divisional structures so that would be things like the em team so what that means is that's a very standard acronym for europe middle east and asia or sorry africa sorry other ones are na a for north america an apa pack for asia pacific and then also lat for latin america those are the standard divisional structures of that our teams or divisions based on geographic lake location we could also look at things if you're a bank on a team that is responsible for online banking and other ones responsible for retail banking which isn't really about function but is organized in a different way and of course a matrix structure combines those two things so why is this important well it's because organizational structure is a way of representing it's the it's the mental model and it's the system of an organization to organize roles in responsibilities the accountability of that of that division but also how people are allocated and coordinated within that organization so who does what who reports to who and how now most organizations follow one of these three options although there there are other ways of of structuring your organization there's no right or wrong way so you know just to talk a little bit more about each of these this functional structure one this is really based on skills or competencies expertise divisional is by customer region product or service then we look at that matrix one this is a combination of the too so for instance we we might have a a finance expert who works on the online banking project as an adviser or something like that too alright next let's talk about management styles in the guide we cover three key kinds of three ways of thinking about management styles for a total of six forms of management formal versus informal centralized versus decentralized in tall versus flat so in terms of formal or informal management the key idea here is to consider how much of the role is governed by explicit rules and regulations for or how much of it is organic and at hoc again there's no right or wrong way here but some places will be highly formal some places will be quite informal sometimes those aren't a decision that the organization gets to make if you look at a tax company or a bank and insurance company a medical company these are highly regulated industries that often have to have very formal management styles to ensure that the organization is able to meet the correct audit and accountability requirements by a local or international law then we look at the dimension of whether the management style is centralized or decentralized so what percent of the decisions are made by a centralized team that's not an exact that'll never be an exact measurement but our things mostly made by a centralized team such as north american headquarters ceo coo cfo roles or are they done more decentralized by your regional office such as the munich office or the mumbai office or something like that then lastly we talk about tall or flat structures how many levels of management are there office is there a ceo an associate senior vp an associate vp a junior vp senior director junior director a senior manager junior manager team lee and how many levels are there between you and the in the top of the organization or is there a c suite with a with a couple of v vps of a few directors and team managers something like that again the no right or wrong so what's most important here is that the type of structure that an organization uses is needs to be shaped and we'll end up will end up being dependent on things like its environment it's strategy it's history and things like that as i've said several times there's no correct or incorrect choice here there's things that better aligned to this strategy and outcomes of an organization that things that have a poor alignment with the strategy can outcome sought by the organization for example if an organization wanted to innovate quickly it might that might be really harder or challenging that's you know formal and centralized it's not gonna be able to attract and the type of employees that are that select for lots of innovation so existing employees will find it hard to innovate because the amount of approval need for new ideas or changes and that is the first topic organization and people
Unit 7 - 4 Dimesions of SM - Topic 4.webm: now we'll take a look at the last topic for unit seven value streams and processes this is defined in the guide as the that this dimension is concerned with how the various parts of the organize organic work in an integrated in coordinated way so i think that's really important i i do think that value streams and processes is a pretty abstract way of describing that coordination and collaboration sound like something that would be a more direct description but i also really appreciate that these are all processes and that in till four the idea of the value stream is very important and that idea of focusing on value which focuses on outcomes and also the c creation of value is critical to the kind of change and new thinking new philosophy they're trying to bring to practices so the full definition continues to say that this is concerned with all the ways that the parts of the oh how all the different parts of the organization work in an integrate coordinate way to enable value creation through products and services the and that this dimension focuses on what activities the organization undertake and how they are organized as well as how the organization ensures that it is enabling value creation for all stakeholders efficiently and effectively so we can say that this dimension is how well do you work together as an organization and how successful are you at delivering value value stream and streams and processes for products and services help to find what is the generic delivery model for the service and how does the service work what are the value streams involved in delivering the agreed outputs of the service and who are what platforms are required for the service oh who are what performs the required sir as actions so let's let's continue to take a look a little closer at the idea of the value stream this is defined in the it ideal guide as a series of steps and organization undertake to create and deliver products and services to consumers so implicit in that is that the purpose of that product and or service is to deliver value to the consumer that's why it's called a value stream so regardless of what you're delivering regardless of what the output of the product or services if it's not delivering value and it's not successful okay so what are values what is that what does this actually look like we've talked a little bit about we've defined value streams what are the actual activities of of a value stream well but you need to examine the work and need to map value stream so you need to have some kind of visualization and this gives you a way of understanding and articulating and then ultimately evaluating and improving a value stream which is effectively a series of processes you need to analyze streams and steps to identify waste then you need to eliminate the waste so you can see that each step is up walking through the process of that analysis evaluation and improvement that i was just mentioning lastly we sorry next we identify improvements and then lastly we optimize it's continually optimize value streams and that last step really means that this is a great big cycle that never really ends so on a periodic basis you should be doing this with all of your processes alright so in that first step there it talked about value stream mapping so let's make sure we understand what that means a value stream map is a visual tool to enable organizations to understand its value streams but beyond simply being a visual tool and let's be honest it's it's it could be a very simple diagram and in the next example we have a very simple diagram but having a shared vocabulary way a a a shared reference point for everyone to have an next explicit description an understanding of that value stream of that set of processes is incredibly important because we've talked about how important communication is clear and consistent of communication alignment but we both talked how important collaboration is so a tooling like value stream maps might seem quite simple but i encourage you to really think about how much time they can save bite simply and elegantly having a shared reference point that's explicit and understandable by everyone in the organization or potentially even outside of the organization if you're sharing value mass with a particular stakeholder so that you're able to quickly describe and have success successfully shared understanding the same thing and go back to it and so as you're going through those steps of the value stream activities that you're able to be able to successfully say well here i think there's a choke point where here i think we're taking too long or this is too expensive or why is this the next step could we change the sequence those are the kinds of benefits that you accelerate the conversation getting those things instead of spending lots of time having to explain and correct and make sure that everyone has the same idea of how the value stream is is working it also gives you the opportunity for someone to say actually that's not how it works that would typically in in my experience fees like a frontline support person i wouldn't want to to get a value stream into circulation without validating it with the people who use it i could be frontline workers it could be engineers or people that help ask you good potentially be customers to say hey how are you actually doing this what does this process like for you and then see how how much their description matches what you've created internally so all of that to say that this enables the organization to explain measure and improve their value streams alright let's take a look at an example so here's an example of a value stream mac so we can see that there's a a particular value and this comes straight from the i the it itunes guy right so a sales team member request the software and the help desk of records your request and escalate it to a manager for approval then there's the approval and the software is deployed to the sales team member so this is like hey i have a i i i need a vi to to put together something i need a canvas license i need access to salesforce lightning whatever it is right and so we're saying that the actual cost or the time for each of these things we can see here is relatively small less than an hour total but we can also see that they're mapping a certain kind of delay so we now have a sales team member blocked for two days to do what we're gonna assume is an essential and required task because of this process so let's go a little bit deeper right so this entire so what's the scenario here right we walked through what we see on the map let's talk a little bit more about that scenario to help connect the dots and how this map would connect in their would reflect a situation in the real world so and for our organizations mapping the value stream of deploying our crm software to the sales team member so let's stick with our salesforce model sales staff are reporting that it's really slow and the delays you know blocking them from being successful in in in their work and it's a significant problem for them so they decide that their first w to map the value stream and try to identify any bottlenecks and so the steps that we've seen previously we identify all the activities and the steps in the process then we also record the average time it takes for each step and the average wait time between each step this is a very important thing that we're not just measuring the time for the activities but the overall delivery which means to say the outcome of the that sales team member getting access to the software so we measured just the activity we said the delivery of this takes five ten twenty five fifty five minutes sounds pretty great but we're not looking at the outcome from the users per resort from the customer perspective and customer doesn't have to be somebody who pays us right it's the person that we're delivering the service for customer so then then we map on this map this onto a simple diagram sorry we show the value at times the time to complete each step in the wait times as well that makes it very clear for us to identify the delays that could be reduced perhaps using the longest layer the one that is simplest to fix i really like that example because you know this two day one's pretty pretty significant but if it's really hard if we have there's a paper process where we have to send the pdf out and say fax i'm very old but we would have to send something off to the supplier to get another license yeah that's gonna be really hard so maybe we can address these five minute ones doesn't really gonna work out really important here but let's say this one was one day here and we found out that we weren't that these kinds of messages we're getting caught by a spam filter we could write a rule in our email service to make sure that they don't get caught by the spam filter and we could advise sales team managers to write a rule to give it a high priority give them an immediate alert to try to to close that down for example so where we you look where the longest delay is we have approval and deployment right quite a bit of time so what kinds of solutions could could we have what we definitely need to know the root cause of the problem but potentially some automation would be the right kind of thing maybe that we're waiting for a person on the help desk to see this message and process it maybe we can write a rule rules a little bit simple simplistic maybe we could introduce some automation that would take that approval in this a software provisioning system and automatically create the new account for the sales team member on salesforce one one possible example alright so that was talking about value streams this dimension definitely has two sections to value streams and processes so let's take a look at processes so it's simply described as a set of activity that transform inputs into outputs the it two guide goes on to say that processes described what is done to accomplish an objective and well defined processes can improve productivity within and across organizations they're usually detailed in procedures which outline who's is involved in process work instructions and explain how they're carried out this is a really great definition of some things i really like about this in particular the idea that it's focused on objectives not deliverables that's what is the outcome that we're seeking right that they're a detailed procedures there's an accountability piece who is involved work instructions document the steps and explain how they're carried out provides the context to ensure that the people doing the work the process can't be successful so a process is is a set of inter related or interacting activities that transforms inputs to outputs right processes are designed to accomplish a specific objective this is an important thing if if you see a process of some documentation and that process is designed to do more than one thing i would immediately throw a flag hey just wanna check this looks like it's doing more than one thing is that gonna be is that gonna be building in the right kind of success into this process alright i wanna talk a little bit about devops so i really like that it ideal fours is now dealing with some parts of devops so what we have here is is at the top of very simple like ridiculously simple process diagram input activity and output right so that is a the simplest possible form of process right and you know i i don't think this is almost no process would actually be the simple but you know successful processes ours efficient and efficient it shouldn't be more than than you need to get done and it's really important to remember that i told to set practices on a checklist of things to implement and so why am i bringing that at well it within the devops community the were process you know has a time some negative connotation and previously in previous versions of it you know there's been a perception that it's it overall it's periodic bureaucratic process driven and it's gonna you know slow down work it's gonna you know make it hard to get things to flow and ultimately not help us get things done some organizations looked at it three and they considered a catalog of things that and wanted to implement every single one and if they implemented them all and checked all the boxes somehow they'd be done doing it it's certainly not what ever was intended to do but it's important to have just enough process to get the job done and that's the idea of sufficient and e that's true both for each individual process but over your it ideal service where all of your service management overall when you have too much process it can definitely be a blocker can creep unnecessary friction and and the worst case scenario was the people ultimately avoid or skip during the process and just figure it out on their own which means you don't have alignment you don't have communication you don't have collaboration but having no press at all processes at all will likely lead to chaos or at least something that's very difficult to measure and understand and report on each organization needs to adopt and adapt processes to help it meet its own organizational goals that's very important that those processes are reviewed regularly remember that's part of the value stream activities that is to you know continually be looking at the opportunity to update and improve to make sure that they're still efficient and effective the updates that we see in it four guidance focus exactly on these practices and are seeking to improve and revise the perception of it being bureaucratic and process heavy and that wraps up topic four and that's the end of unit seven so i invite you to ask any questions you have on ms teams or on discussions
Unit 8 - Service Value - Topic 1.webm: next for unit eight we'll take a look at service value the outcomes for this unit are to introduce the concept of service value and explore and discuss two key things the service value system and service value change both of which you should be able to explain at the end of this unit we have two topics in this unit the service value system and service value chains resources for this unit you expect to read chapters seven six seven nine and ten this is more than listed in in the instructional plan so just to be clear that it's a little bit of extra reading the additional chapters are very short i just wanted to we'll make sure that we had slightly better coverage than i initially planned for the course ongoing reminder that we're on the second edition of the book so make sure that you are reading the correct version of our textbook book okay let's get started with unit one and take a look at the service value system so what does that mean well it's a model that represents how all the components and activities of an organization work together to facilitate value creation a pretty broad generic definition overall relatively good though you know the system of value is you know it's one way to describe organization's period it's what organizations are intended to do if an organization isn't able to work together to facilitate value creation then it'd be fair to say that that is an in ineffective over or perhaps a failed organization so there's this diagram from the book that talks about opportunity and demand and how that drives the set the service value chain in parts of that are the guiding principles governance practices and continuing improvement and ultimately that results in value this is another one of those diagrams where i'm not entirely sure what it's trying to say i i understand that it illustrates all of the pieces of this if you find it helpful that's great i think that it it doesn't an okay job of making sure that you we have a visualization of each of the components of the service value system so let's start looking at a little bit more of the overall idea here and that is let's remind ourselves of what value is and for value is measured by the customer and the organization and let's reflect back on one of the guiding principles of it ideal focus on value and what that means is you know understanding and identifying the service customer of the consumer's perspective of value mapping value to intended outcomes and understanding that those things are gonna change the organization that's gonna have to adapt if the if we're able to continue to to be able to be able to continue to deliver that value and also understanding customer experience or user experience organization's employees can only focus on value if they understand what value means for that organization and its customer so if if the if every member of the organization isn't aligned of what value is for the organization of the customer then it'll be very challenging probably impossible for that employee to help deliver that value so for example does an organization value profit over everything else or does it value long term customer relationships or is it its market location or position as an innovator when you have a lot of layers of management in hierarchical structure so this is for a larger that vowed the idea value may only be understood at those more senior or upper echelon frontline workers may be seen as less in value is communicated to them this is not a good outcome so adopting a flatter structure with fewer layers of management can really benefit being able to have that shared understanding of value so that all employees can help contribute to it so that was the right hand side of the diagram let's take a look at the left hand side that opportunity in demand so the book talks about opportunity demand lead to the creation of value that it's always entering the system but the organization does not automatically accept all opportunities or satisfy all demands so opportunities are a service provider are ways that a service provider or the potential work services that the provider can provide to add value for stakeholders customers or could be internal as well or somehow improve their own organization all organizations need to prioritize their work and and do that in the context of how many resources they have that's money that's people that supplies and also so much time they have and when they allocate for new or chain services they need to allocate enough to make sure that they're getting the right improvements at the right time always difficult to to there's no guaranteed way to make those measurements or understand exactly what must be done so it's not about finding the right way it's about finding a right way too much focus on just one area is always gonna lead to a a problem on the on the longer term for instance if you only focus on improving existing services then you won't have very much ready for the next big market change when there's a a significant innovation if you only focus on new services then your existing customers will feel ignored and neglected and be unhappy so how do we identify opportunities this is very important for any organization you always have to be thinking about what's the next thing that we're going to do there's lots of different techniques for that the one that the the ideal guy talks about is the blue ocean red ocean or ocean approach here we look at the red ocean as a metaphor for it an established market with entrenched players and well understood products well understood customers and a lot of competition a blue ocean is an untapped market space low competition where the organization can create customers a blue ocean is the potential to provide rapid growth large profits and identifying blue ocean opportunities for a service provider can really help where identify the a strong strategy for allocating resources that are based on opportunity i really appreciate that the it ideal guy takes a look at the the concept of a minimal minimum viable product that comes from the lean startup and a little bit from the toyota lean production system so it's really important to remember and that just because the customer give us an idea it isn't necessarily a good one or even it's a good one it might not be a profitable one for us so whatever people say that they want and what they actually need they can be very different things so when we see an opportunity we need to make sure that the demand actually exists and that could be blue ocean brainstorming activity where we identify a new opportunity it could be a major customer or someone on twitter saying hey i think you guys should do this just because it sounds like a good idea doesn't mean that's idea even if it comes from the customer so what are we supposed to do in that situation well agile software agile development describes or has the practice of building a minimum viable product to provide feedback to test the hypothesis to validate the hypothesis so an mvp has just enough features to satisfy early customers and the word customer here very important because an mvp needs to be sold this isn't something you're giving away and it can be really beneficial to identify any incorrect assumptions that made by doing it in a minimal in a minimal way you're reducing the cost reducing the waste to be able to identify what what parts of the product liver value of arts don't this reduces the overall cost cost and risk associated with a development of that project we can also include some market analysis before we even start any development that's a really important thing so talking to some of your customers doing some user research so in the book they talk about five key things that an mvp will provide for you or what the value or the reason for viewing the first is that it allows a product hypothesis to be tested and it's this is the it's with the second piece is so important by using minimal resources that's so important that those two things are are tightly bound together in your understanding of an mvp it's also gonna accelerate x accelerate learning because by going with something minimal by getting to market quickly your your moving up the timeline of your feedback in the real market and there's no substitute for real market ex experience although certainly user research ahead of time well can't definitely minimize wrong ideas or raw moving forward the wrong hypothesis it's also gonna let you get product or service to a customer as as soon as possible and shorten the feedback loop you're gonna get feedback from your customers much faster by by doing this i encourage you to take a look at something like the apple pc two as an example of what happens when you don't build an mvp and put millions of dollars and years into product that it turns out nobody wants and you can't sell okay let's talk now about the elements of the service value system so there's some things here that we're already quite familiar with such as the guiding principles but we see some other things here i won't wanna read them all off to you but we'll we'll go through each of these with the remainder of this of this video but i i do wanna start off with the definition from the guide on what the service value system is the it tel service value system describes how all components and activities of an organization work together as a system to enable value creation each organizations service value system has interfaces with other organizations forming an of them that can turn facilitate value for those organizations their customers and their stakeholders so you remember that from the this the opening and the introduction of this topic but this time i included the the full description and i wanted to make sure we a chance to reflect on that as well i think it's very important that we look at the way we create value with an organization as systemic and that the way the organizations network with each other and build collaborative systems or inter systems of value as an ecosystem that's a very important observation something for us all to reflect on alright so let's look at these different elements let's first talk about those guiding principles sure we remember those we did them in unit five so what were they focused on value start where you are progressing if italy iterative lead with feedback collaborate and promote visibility think and work holistically keep it simple and practical optimize and automate you can just go back to unit five if you wanna review oracle call in in more depth than any of those okay the next is governance peninsula the governing body is accountable for the or organization's compliance with policies and external regulations so to to open that up a little bit more the book indicates that every organization is directed by a governing body that is a person or group of people who are accountable the highest level for the performance and compliance of the organization all sizes and types of organizations perform governance activities that governing body may be or directors an executive manager or other things like that to take on a separate governance role when they're performing governing activities the governing body is accountable for the organization's compliance with policies in any external regulations so you know just to put that in a little more natural language that isn't trying to stake out a a very particular definition organizational governance is responsible for evaluating direct and monitoring and organization's activities including its service management i really like this because it frames governance as an organizational activity in service management is one part of that of course project management will be included in that as well so the level of governance within an organization could be defined by many factors it's size but industry it's in so certainly if you're in the oil petrochemical industry if you're in the pharmaceutical industry if you're financial insurance as mean lots of compliance requirements or environmental standard works safety standards legal financial standards things like that if the company is public listed or if it's a privately owned a company and also the culture within which it operates now sometimes the government body doesn't provides sufficiently clear direction and when that happens is a risk that managers will make decisions on their own and they don't align with each other or with the overall strategy vision or requirements the compliance requirements of that organization the it book takes a look at the volkswagen emissions scandal where the vision for the volkswagen group is we are a globally leading provider of sustainable mobility including being a role model for environment safety integrity but clear with that vision wasn't understood by the departments that created test that allowed polluting vehicles on the road by by providing fraudulent data to the test mechanism sense and ultimately that decision destroyed a lot of shareholder value and brand equity for the for the brand of of volkswagen okay that's governance let's take a look at service value chain so this is defined as the central element of sps it's and operating model that outlines the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value through products and services not bad little bit little bit complex there but you know it's a it's how it's the actual process and work of delivering value important to be clear that this is a set of interconnected activities that an organization performs and ultimately it needs to deliver that value to its customers or to facilitate value realization and that very broad term at the end included there is to represent or maybe include any notion of how the service could just benefit ourselves the next topic focuses on service value chain so i'll i'll return to that at that time next we can take a look at service value practices these are a set of organizational resources a designed for performing work or accomplishment objective this is the work that an organization does so each ideal practice supports lots of different service value chain activities and they may they're made up by resources from the four dimensions of service management that's organization and people information and technology partners and suppliers value streams and processes now when we get into those practices the it ideal service value system practices there are thirty four of them in total fourteen general management practices seventeen service management practices and three technical management practices so what are those kinds of things what are those different types mean well general management practices are adopted and adapted just for running the business we can think of them as operational so service management practices or those that have originated and developed in service management and its m and then lastly the technical ones are the ones that been how a originated in technology management and have been adapted for service management and we'll take a detailed look at all of those this is in unit nine so we'll leave those aside for now so next we'll talk about continual improvement so this is of the recurring organizational activity that's to performed to ensure that we're always aligned with the changing stakeholder expectations continued improvement is a very important part of the service value system it's something that we talked about in the project management side of this as well it it this is a practice so you're gonna see this in unit nine but i think it's very important that the item material highlights it this is absolutely essential if you don't have a strong focus and continuing improvement then eventually your processes will be subject to rust or k how whatever kind of metaphor process debt whatever you like and eventually you'll get more and more inefficient not only that but the needs of our stakeholders the opportunities presented by new technologies new vendors things like that sometimes negative things like a global pandemic or something like that well impose new restrictions that'll change the context of how our organization operates and we need to be always keeping our eye on how to improve our practices given those those kinds of changes and just one more time just to highlight that this is a common characteristic of the pin block as well alright lastly we'll take a look at inputs and outcomes for this for these elements and this is an input is a request for the service something that triggers the activity and the output is of the service is an outcome i have a a short link here our book didn't do a particularly good job of describing this so i'm pulling this from chapter two from the service management for dummies you are not required to read this but i just wanted to source this it is available on o'reilly so if you wanted to look at it you're you're more than welcome to so let's talk a little bit more about outputs outputs could per b could include things like products or services be anything like a physical product an apple pod to an outcome mode lawn could potentially be a product and a service at a a meal and restaurant service so you know not only do you get the food but they also seat you and refill your drinks and cook the food clean up through the dishes so the internal activity of the service transforms the inputs into outcome so the input is some kind of request and then some kind of action happens inside of the organization then then we get the outcome so this almost always involves people right so then there's a skilled participant involves the assets and tools which could be as simple as pen paper or it could be a whole manufacturing plant that and that delivers the service there's also gonna be some kind of standard process models we know that it's repeatable and scalable that's the method for delivering the service the process could be so simple that a skilled participant can pick it up in a few hours or could be very complex consisting of rules and systems that determine how whole department with an organization carries out its work one last thing before i move on i don't like the equation here of output with outcome the reason i say that is in the last several years design thinking and lean design have reframe these as opposite concepts and that an out that an output would be a mere deliverable where an outcome would be meeting the needs of the customer and it it can be very dangerous to assume those two things are the same so just a little bit of editorial commentary for me alright we'll wrap up this this topic by talking about silos the whole reason that the service value system is so important is because it talks what a system that goes across an organization that means sbs is is purpose built to help knock down and knock reinforced silos within an organization so we talked about silos with with pin pinpoint as well and we talked about silos with it and they exist when a team or department only focus on their own area of work and don't factor the big picture and don't think about the whole organization holistically when there are lots of silos or when the silos are strong with an organization then it's significantly more difficult for that organization to be agile to be resilient because what they're doing is they're limiting their ability to communicate and they reduce the power of collaboration so what the one are the specific consequences well there's a a nice list in the it guide but they're they were all very long so i i changed this slightly these terms are mine but i'm gonna read through them and the share the exact same content but i i thought a bit of organization would be helpful here so when you have silos you're gonna be slow and that means you'll have an inability to act quickly or take advantage of opportunities you're gonna end up being wasteful you're gonna reduce the ability to optimize resources of resource use story across organization you're gonna be subject to bad decisions because you're gonna make poor decision you're gonna be have for decision making because you don't know what the other teams you're doing you're gonna end up with a kind of blindness you're gonna poor visibility or lack of transparency you're gonna end up with unhealthy politics with hidden agendas and an increase in unhealthy organizational politics often silos will lead to a lot of competition between between departments or or teams and then lastly confusion a lack of clarity about about value streams interfaces and hand points is gonna make it harder for everyone to be successful doing their job and ultimately diminish the success of the organization and that is the end of unit one
Unit 8 - Service Value - Topic 2.webm: next we'll take a look at the service value chain so what is the service value chain well our book identifies it as an operating model that outlines the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value through products and services so we saw this definition previously in the last topic but this topic focuses is exclusively on it so what are those kinds of activities well there are six of those activities plan improving engage design and transition obtain slash build deliver and support so let's take a look at the diagram and the book on this quite similar to to the last diagram once again i i think that this doesn't tell much of a story i've also read a couple of reviews of this diagram that they're absolutely in love with it i think that what they really appreciate is the new content or the way it ideal version four brings together so many of these things in a way that really help support organizations being successful by addressing some important cultural dimensions as opposed to just you know how to schedule server path update or something like that something that's really important when you look at this diagram to be clear though that these activities don't necessarily happen in a linear flow or don't follow any particular sequence things could happen in parallel be repeated or we occur as a series of iterations or loops you have different kinds of work depending on the on the product services and customers and all those things could in each case provide a different route through the value chain so let's take a look an example if you wanted to develop an application that's brand new then the way that you use your service value chain or your path through the service value chain will be very different than if you're updating an existing one so you know these are an organization's values streams you know the combination of practices and value chain activities that lead to value keep in mind that each value chain at activity relies on inputs and creates outputs for other activities and this can be quite a large map of possible connections we'll see more of that soon to convert inputs into outputs the value chain uses combinations of different ideal practices which are sets of resources designed for performing doom specific kinds of work so each activity could use resources processes skills or competencies and those things could come from inside or outside the organization i'm gonna this bears is repeating all activities are interconnected but skipping activity or spending less time on on on it than it's needed will impact the whole value chain as other activities will not receive the inputs they need so this isn't quite so much a pick and choose the ones that work for you but certainly you need to ensure that you adapt or calibrate the investment the focus on each step to be appropriate to the the the specific kind of value that you're trying to deliver here's some key points to remember about a service value chain activities before we get into each of them engage includes all engagement activities so that is you know whether it's internal directional customers suppliers subject matter matter experts participating in in your organization's value chain all of it all new resources are obtained through obtain slash build all planning takes place in the client activity component product and service creation modification delivery maintenance and support are performed in an integrated way by the design and transition obtain slash build in deliver and support activities and then lastly product and services demand and value our sps components but they are not value chain activities that was a sort of a higher level overview will now dive into each of these service value chain activities and take a look at them so first we'll take a look at plan which is the purpose of of the plan value chain activity is to ensure a shared understanding of the vision current status and improvement direction for all four dimensions in all products and services across the organization information inputs from the plan activity are used to create key outputs including improvement opportunities for the improve activity and contracts agreements for the engage activity so for each of these activities we'll take a look at the inputs and outputs i'm not gonna go through and read them all that's the reading in the book and you can take a look at you could pause and take a look at what's on the slide i do wanna highlight a couple of these through each of these i particularly like here the idea of knowledge and it's the last two knowledge information about new or changed products and services and also what to turn externally provided service component so in the opening of this topic i talked about how continual improvement is so important because the we always have shifting ground the context of the market new entrants new technologies all those things are always changing and so adapting our organization our services adapting the value we deliver requires us to pay close attention to that in terms of key outputs for the plan pretty keith not very surprising things here things like new strategy new tactics architecture policies new products services all those kinds of things one thing i wanna highlight here is you're gonna see we have we we're gonna identify things like where the inputs come from from other activities but also where we're gonna see different kinds of activities be the output or where those outputs need to go okay let's take a look at improve next so the improve activity this is the purpose of the improved value chain activity is to ensure continual improvement of products services and practices across all value chain activities and the four dimensions of service management delivering support provides service performance information and engage provide stakeholder feedback outputs include improvement initiatives status reports and service performance information for design insurance transition so what i really like and what i want you to be very clear on is that in the metaphor of the service value chain is so important because you see how each of these linked together via inputs and outputs and there's no required order or a number of times or anything like that and and in almost every case every chain in the service value every link in the chain is it's gonna be required to to achieve success so here we see the inputs and the outputs the one i'm going to focus on here particularly is just product and service information and i wanna spend some time on this because i wanna make sure that we're thinking about health checks and a user analytics performance analytics so things like what's the error rate what's our uptime what is our satisfaction rate how many four zero four or page founders can we identify the the frequency what are the top ten search items on our help page all those kinds of things i think can be very very important in terms of the outputs the thing that i'd like to focus on here is service perform sorry i got a service performance in our in that information right here so how do we actually get that back out to improve our services right how do we close the loop so i some of these other things having you know initiatives and plans and value chain performance information improvement status reports these are all great but i wanna to focus on you getting getting it out to the customer so next we'll talk about engage the definition of this activity is that the purpose of the engage value chain activity is to provide a good understanding of stakeholder needs transparency and continual feedback and continual engagement sorry so engage provides oversight of requests and feedbacks from customers it also looks at incidents to help identify improvement opportunities this isn't just about engaging with the customer but also was suppliers subject matter experts will perhaps a consultant or throughout the organization internal management all stakeholders right this is to ensure that we have good relationships with all stakeholders this is very very important and i'm really happy to see this as part of it this is a long list but of an eye chart apologies for that the thing that i particularly like here is cooperation opportunities and feedback from partners and suppliers i really like that i was gonna highlight incident service request and feedback from users i like these two because it's hearing directly from people from the themselves right so if we look at detailed requirements that's gonna get filtered by our team who's recording those we're look at contracts or agreements that's a whole step away maybe two or three degrees of separation from the end user and things like that so i really like when we're talking about to engaged i encourage you to prioritize actually hearing from your customer from the supplier from the stakeholder themselves in their own language using their own words hopefully in a way where you can see their body language and have a conversation and go through a a user research or a customer research script questionnaire here but also some time to dive deeper and have some some follow up questions as well in terms of the outputs i particularly like the change or project initiation requests so like how like what are you gonna what change are you going to do what project what thing are we gonna do different now that we're going to have to obtain by or a loan borrow whatever whenever by or bill ourselves to to improve our our the value that we deliver next like it let's take a look at design and transition this is defined as the purpose of the design and transition value chain activity is to ensure that products and services continually make meet stakeholder expectations for quality costs and time to market lots there so this is this activity receives portfolio decisions as an input as well as informational about components from the supplier through the engage activity what we're gonna get are requirements and specifications that we then provide as inputs to obtain build and contract requirements that are passed to engage this is another one that's got quite a few things associated with it the thing that i'd like to focus on here are product and service requirements i i see that because there are some other places where we deem emphasize this but when you're in that design phase really understanding those requirements very very important and any drift you have from the stakeholder requirements so you're building something that no one asked for or or based on a a misunderstanding or a hypothesis that is is incorrectly formed it it can be very expensive by the time you get to the to the delivery phase also you remember in the last slide we just talked about how important is to talk directly with those stakeholders and that's where we're gonna get these product and service requirements so this is the right time to prioritize product and service when you're doing that design and transition taking a look at the inputs sorry for the outputs i'm gonna stick with the same thing here drawing a direct line from product and service requirements right to requirements and specifications for a obtain and build because that's how we're gonna build that mv or or that next iteration of our service that's well aligned with our stakeholder requirements so let's move on to chain and build that's the next activity and this is our book rights here or indicates the purpose of the obtain slash build value chain activity is to ensure that service components are available when and where they're needed and meet and create specifications so we need to this whole i'd love that this is called obtain slash build i typically use language of buy slash bill but i appreciate the the are things that you could non buying options but the key difference is is it do you use a supplier or do you make it yourself so obtain slash build so anytime we're gonna deliver anything but the organization needs to make a decision are we gonna create the product and services or are we gonna use external resource or some combination are we gonna buy a framework or a platform and then customize it for ourselves white label it or something like that so in terms of inputs and outputs here on the key inputs i particularly would like us to focus on the change requests i i like this one a lot i mean we could take a different perspective i mean we could take a look at the goods and services that our suppliers have and pick from those but what i like about change requests is that that typically is gonna be coming from our customer you'll notice i i'm pretty consistent with trying to prioritize voice of the customer throughout this entire process that's not to say the other things aren't important they are if this isn't an either or we can do all of these things but where how we prioritize is very important and putting the customer at the center having a customer centric philosophy is very important because that's how we achieve the right value whenever remember the value gets measured by the organization and the customer so our value measurement it's always gonna be was it profitable are we able to scale this in a way are we able to deliver in a way that we're able to have enough margin that we're able to be a successful organization and build and grow in the directions that that we intent but that's only ever gonna happen from the happy customer if you can't deliver what the the value that the customer looking for they're gonna go hire someone else buy someone else's product so that's why i'm so focused on talking about inputs and outputs that are customer focus again not to the exclusion of anything else but in terms of a prioritization so lastly here i'm gonna talk about what like what are the key outputs here but gonna go with just straight service components i i wish there was product in here as well but really just what are you building right that that that's the key thing okay sorry it doesn't have to good what are you delivering sorry whether you obtain or build it there you go okay so we'll talk about the deliver and support next this is defined in our guide as the purpose of delivering support value chain activity is to ensure that services are delivered and supportive according to agreed specifications and stakeholder expectations so you know this activity is gonna receive newer updated services because they get obtained or built that includes service components from obtain built and user support task from improve the outputs will include new and updated services being offered to users so this is when we actually are able to get it into the hands of our customers so let's take a look at these key inputs for deliver and support the one that i particularly like here is taking a look at new or change of products and services from design transition or just service components for obtain built so like what are the new things that we're able to give our our customers now improvement initiatives of status reports these are okay they the way they're phrase for me it feels a little bit weak in terms of what they're actually delivering i i don't think a status reports can be very interesting into a customer necessarily if that improvement initiative includes things that you're gonna obtain and build and then the lever and support i think that sounds great so in terms of the key outputs here we have the services right so that we deliver to those customers and that's that's the key one everything on this list is is pretty great you'll notice that i've not focused on on contracts and agreement requirements i don't want to say that they're not important they are but that's very much more so that general management that business management part of it and if those are important stakeholders if you if you can't get lawyers on on on the customer side to consistently agree to your service agreement if your pricing is off and you can't close deals because it's too high yeah those are those are all very important and and critical things but ultimately those are the people that use the service or the product that we deliver so i wanna make sure that i'm being clear that for me at least it's very important to prioritize that customer experience over over everything else okay that wraps up our second topic can wraps up the unit look forward to any questions that you have four unit eight
Unit 9 - Intro.webm: hello and welcome to delivering service management unit nine in this unit we'll be taking a look at a large number of management practices for it tail we will discuss and explore general service and technical management practices when you complete this unit you'll be able to compare general it management practices as well as service practices and technical practice lastly you'll be able to explain the difference between those kinds of practices overall we have an intro this time it's a little bit longer in addition to that intro we have three topics delivering general management practices and then also one for service and technical the general service sections are quite long and the technical is quite short for unit nine you are required to read chapters eleven twelve thirteen and fourteen some of them are quite long some of them are very short so before we dive in let's make sure that we're level set on what the term practices mean in it and this is defined as a practice is a set of organizational resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective this is a very broad i didn't quite generic definition but as you see we have a lot of things that need to fit in this bucket it's also very important to keep in mind that these practices are all part of the it ideal service value system the other key thing to touch on before we get into the details of these many different practices is that all of them sit on top of the four dimensions of service management that's worth noting this is true of every part of ti very important we don't lose sight of organization and people information and technology partners and suppliers and value streams and processes as we talk about all of these different practices so let's take a slightly closer look and understand what the scope of this unit is there's thirty four it ideal service value system practices in total fourteen of them are general management practices seventeen our service management practices and three are technical to be clear general management practices are quite broad and for business in general as we go through them you'll see that they'll apply to pretty much any business organization and not specifically to it tail but since it service value systems are typically contained within a business it's a essential that that business thrive and that we have the right focus on how to support successful it m or it activities within the organization then we'll take a look at service management practices and these are more specific to it s m and so these have been identified developed and now reflect the core practices and running it service management and then lastly we're gonna look at a small set of technology management practices which are meet at the intersection of technology and service management okay so let's take a moment to make sure that we're taking some time to reflect on the difference between processes and practices what we see in it ideal v four is a very important shift in an emphasis and framing of the content and the the culture the values the systems of it from processes to practices so i'm gonna go through and read these definitions here just to make sure that we're very clear this is quite important for two reasons because it represents and describes a very important shift in it philosophy and thinking but also keep in mind that it v four is still relatively new in many organizations will be continuing to use it v three and that's perfectly fine it's a it's a good system these updates i think are in version four are needed and timely and add extra value but there's still a lot of excellent things in virgin three so from version three we see an emphasis on process these are a set of inter related or interacting activities that transform inputs into outputs a process takes one or more to find inputs in terms them into find outputs processes to find the sequence of actions and their dependencies i like this definition quite a bit it's very precise and i think it has a very good clarity and very good scope but let's take a look at this shorter definition for practice which is far more emphasized in for a a practice is a set of organizational resources designed for performing work or accomplishing objective so quite a bit less technical or specific or detailed a little bit more strategic but this is also so to get us into a different way of thinking about what we need to do to be successful in particular this shift is very intentional by the it ideal organization to address the the criticisms that eye is overly bureaucratic but it doesn't integrate well with new ways of working like agile software development or devops and that because of that it's too inflexible so you can see by moving to a broader less strain definition they're able to have that kind of flexibility and help better integrate with those kinds of newer work methods like agile software development and devops that doesn't mean that processes are not relevant they still are very important so they should be part of i but this isn't trading in one for the other this is about introducing the idea of practices and putting some important emphasis and focus on it so that we're able to be more flexible with the systems we build but still have highly accurate and repeatable processes so successful processes should be closed loop systems they need to be have documents and be shared they need to be directed by policies and they need to be reusable so to be effective we need to make sure that their a closed loop system we'll take a look at this point first that means that we always need to be doing a retrospective or seeking feedback on a process on a regular basis to ensure that we're able to identify any weaknesses or gaps especially those that develop over time as the context or needs of the organization change if a process it doesn't work on the closed loop model that means that they won't improve because you're not getting the benefit from lessons learned from an four active process feedback needs to be used to make improvements across the entire service value system and it's very important that we think about this as a system and keep in mind that processes do not operate in isolation they can influence and affect each other and they should inform each other as well we also wanna make sure the proceed processes are as consistent as possible so that they're easier to have good standards and have compliance and a better user experience whether those users are our customers or our internal colleagues good we also need to make sure that processes are documented so that they can be shared and easily reused throughout the whole organization the other very important part of documentation it gives us a single shared understanding of how that process is intended to operate and its motivation or its intent without that sort of a agreement or written down documentation of the process different teams will end up finding their own ways to execute on those processes everyone will think that they're doing it right and you'll have increasing drift and and decreasing consistency and results across your organization so policy is very very important now this is part of the strategy of processes policies you know are used to document management expectations and the intention for the process if we don't have this kind of policy when we make a process when we develop a process then we will not be able to understand or inform the people who need to do the process of the why or what the intended outcome is this also is how in it four we have processes link up to governance through that policy direction and then lastly we need these processes to be highly reusable this is a very important dimension of value because we're able to become more and more efficient as we get better and better compliance or engagement with well defined processes therefore a single change process could be used across the entire organization instead of each unit team or department having to come up with their own not only does this save time and energy but it also helps the entire organization of the how the shared vocabulary and shared understanding of what these processes are like so let's talk a little bit about process models this is defined in our it ideal guide as a way of designing and mapping a process and can be effective if you need to develop a new process or update an existing one this is a little bit like the service value chain diagram that we we talked about but you know every process still has inputs and outputs just the the shift in it four to give more prominence to practices does not mean that processes don't have inputs and outputs just like processes continue to be very important inputs and outputs are essential to to effective processes so an input we'll we'll start off a process for example if a customer calls our service desk then we will begin a an incident report or a diagnostic process an output means that the iteration of the process is complete and has served its purpose this is one of my favorite definitions in the entire book it's for two things it really tightly ties it to the idea that is not necessarily a one and done or a single cycle process that you can gonna need to go through a the a discovery diagnosis hypothesis for solution and then implementation then test and validate that the that the solution was successful so the fact that this bates the idea of iteration directly into the idea of an output it's great but what's especially valuable about this is that ab this is idea that it has served its purpose this ties the idea of outputs to the idea of outcomes this make sure that the output is aligned to the customer outcome that we need and that's how we deliver value as part of the output we need to make sure that we're asking for feedback and that this reflects back on the idea of being a closed loop so that we continue to develop lessons learned and the idea here or the intent for that is to ensure that we maintain or increase our customer satisfaction process controls need to be put in place to make sure that the that things are working correctly and it does not become ineffective over time so this is a partner to to the closed loop lessons learned or retroactive analysis these kinds of controls could be no a process owner checking the process alignment with policy principles and checking the feedback received so this is operates at a level slightly higher or sorry one order higher than the feedback process because it's gonna also include some organizational and strategic elements as well and that's our intro from here we'll go and take a look at general management practices
Unit 9 - Topic 1.webm: and next take a look at unit nine point one delivering general management practices so here are all of the different general management practices is i won't read these we're gonna go through each of these individually so it's very important to understand that what is an it practice and what is a business practice in today's world of digital trans formation is no longer particularly clear and what's critical is that every part of organization needs to be able to collaborate and not be siloed so that we're able to work together to deliver the services that our customers need while still ensuring that we get to market in a reasonable time and that as always we have the right investment in focus on quality to make sure that we're delivering value the it general management practices are examples of domain that have both an it and of business relevance so while supplier management has relevance for both it and non it suppliers i'm sorry for example supplier management has relevance for both it and non it suppliers where the it department has developed effective ways of working you should be shared with the rest of the organization as well and vice versa the it organization needs to understand no and have visibility on the successful practices of the rest of the organization so that the it department can adopt those practices as well so let's take a look and get started with the general management practices starting with continue improvement this is defined in the it ideal guide as the as by saying the purpose of the continual improvement practice is to align the organization's practices and services with changing business needs through the ongoing improvement of products services and practices or any element involved in the management of products and services so this is what you're gonna notice that this is a longer section to talk about this particular practice but it's very important and keep in mind that continual improvement has the potential to improve all other practices so i'm very happy that we're starting with this and that it's certainly i think that the amount of time the i guide spends on this makes a lot of sense in the ic guide they talk about keeping a continual improvement register which potentially be a written document a spreadsheet or a database and the idea here is to be able to record document prioritize track and manage the ideas for improvement or our opportunities for improvement so of course we need a document says prioritize implement and review all the things in the continual improvement register by having a single record of these things or a system of record we will be able to do all these things i would do wanna highlight that this implemented step here isn't always done of course some ideas are never implemented because of cost or timing even if it's a great idea even if we know there'd be sufficient value that doesn't mean that it's feasible or viable there's a number of activities for the practice of continual improvement i'm not gonna go through all of these there's quite a few here but the idea it's really important i i will talk about two are ones that i'd like a a great deal the first one is securing securing time and budget for continual improvement thicker it's very it's easy to talk about continual improvement and it's a it's not an easy thing to do and it comes out of cost now the reason we do continue improvement is because evidence shows us that those investments typically are more likely to pay off with strong return meaning that overall the benefit of the organization will outweigh the cost the other thing that i really wanna talk about here is the making making business case for improve improvement action i really like these two things because it really helped elevate or broaden the conversation of continual improvement beyond how do we do better but how do we ensure that the organization is invested in and supporting the activity is continual improvement and how do we make sure those improvements are focused on our business needs so i wanted to make sure we took some time to highlight those it's very important to keep in mind that continuum improvement isn't something that happens in one on one team or even even if that team is this is the c level executives it continual improvement is something that needs to be happening in every part of the organization it's particularly important that leaders build continual improvement into the organization and support a culture that allows continual improvement to thrive that's definitely in large part why i was so happy and wanted to spend time on this securing time and budget for continued improvement that is a critical way to to embed those kinds of practices into the organization we're gonna see when you have continual proven practices in place those are gonna be those will be accountable for the kind of improvement we see seen and needs to be one of the metrics that is used to to measure teams and leaders it's important that all staff participate participating in these acts activities it needs to be seen as something that everybody owns and everybody participate in in fact we could even see how suppliers and partners could also contribute to these kinds of activities that in that case you're probably writing something in the contract which will have a shared understanding or agreement on how improvements will be measured and reported next we'll look a little bit at the methods and techniques for continue improvement we've talked a number of these and some of them are new like the balance of scorecard which i think is a really it's a a very robust system does it it is a little complex but you get great results out of it we've talked about swap analysis and i i don't wanna go too deep into this the material of in our guide book really just presents this list the big takeaway here recognize a couple of these key phrases for different methods for continuing improvement and know that there's a lot of different options and what's important is making sure that the right fit of this method or technique is right for your team and organization and keep in mind that not every team organization has to do is in the exact same way our guide has a a pretty good diagram here of what the continual improvement model is i really really like that we start off with what is the vision and i really really like the how do we keep the momentum going these are two very key things i won't go too much i'm not gonna sort of read out this entire diagram here but take take some time to study it either here on by pausing or in the it ideal guide but this is just providing us a high level guide for how you could structure or think about how to implement a continual improvement for your team or your organization the key thing is that it's gonna focus on customer value is gonna connect that value back to the organization's vision the other thing about any process model and this one does quite well is that it's gonna divide the work into manageable steps with smaller goals so that you can demonstrate clear progress and build that momentum i'll i think we've said this several times but let's just say it again this kind of improvement is not a one off activity close one initiate one initiative or one program for improvement completes you need to be spinning up another one in fact several of these could be happening parallel throughout up your organization so how do you how do you ensure that your continual improvement program or culture will be successful well there's a couple of key things here the first of them is you've has to be about about your culture it's a a a common mistake to implement continual improvement to sort of allocate staff roles and say you take care of that and then say alright i've checked the box we're done continual improvement is not a one and done it's not a project it's definitely a practice and it's something that's gonna be ongoing it's continuous i know that maybe that sounds obvious with the a name like continual improvement but often people wanna just sort of check off the list check the item off the list and move on and not come back to it if we imagine an organization says this is the continual improvement team then you're not gonna get the right results and they've just been end up being the scape go and the dumpster for all the all the garbage that other teams don't wanna take on so we remember earlier we talk about how important that everyone feels like they take have ownership of continual improvement it's really important that we think about continual improvement it's something that's important for all services not just live services it's in fact that earlier we make an improvement to a service for instance before ships before goes into production gonna be quite a bit more cost effective this is just like testing your code before you publish or distribute it's also make sure we don't jump to conclusions often the ideas that oh we'll here's a problem here's we'll fix it go do it we need to make sure each of these iterations are treated as a hypothesis that we're gonna validate would be validated that the solution actually has the outcome we're looking for then we can roll it out that is effectively a description of an agile technique or an agile methodology and so it's specifically designed for two things reduce waste and shorten the feedback loop so we need to make sure we have a balance set of measurements right we we can't we has to be measurable and but those things could be you know emotional or intangible you know satisfaction happiness engagement but there's also tangible facts time to complete a transaction number of completed service desk calls things like that so we don't go over focus on either of those the emotional or customer experience point with its internal external customers as well as the empirical things are both important and we don't wanna over emphasize or over rotating to either of these and lastly this is very important we wanna measure just enough it's easy to focus too much on measurement and never actually make a change that'll will make things better for our customers it's easy and fast to make to to generate data and if you focus just on the measurement side then you're not gonna have to make the hard decision of a change and whenever you have change change hard so this entire course is about but not only that when you make a change there's also an implicit understanding that you know the what is being tried is better than what we have now sometimes that can cause political friction so it's it's sometimes there's a an interest in just continue to build more and more data you need just enough data for example this isn't exactly on track for or an exact analogy but nick the nielsen norman group has some really great literature on how much user testing you afternoon for a website they say both five people enough and i mean you have the right diversity in that group and things like that and you can't just all you know go to your engineering team and ask five engineers and but assuming you have the right mix of people you actually don't need that many for a significant sample so understanding those kinds that kind of research and that kind of sufficiency in the data you're collecting is very important each of these sections will wrap up with a practice consideration so we can see here that this talks about you know when you first get started with continual improvement it can be really frustrating but you know focus at that time and how it's gonna be iterative and each time you go through it you're gonna be building momentum and you're gonna be learning it's gonna get easier and easier what needs to be fixed or improved can be a very subjective matter i mean the stakeholder approval and management gonna be very important here everyone's gonna have a different opinion of about what's wrong and what needs to be fixed and and what the best solution is and that's gonna have a lot to do with their own biases their role the organization what their goals or agendas are so it's very important that service providers you know don't just blame customers and users but has a a a broad understanding of being really open to following the evidence and listening to all parties and then going back of an idea of what are your values what is your mission because ultimately that kind of information is gonna help guide you in prioritizing the kind of investments you wanna make around continual improvement next we'll talk about the practice of architecture management this is defined in the it ideal guide as the purpose of architecture management is the practice to provide an understanding of all the different elements that make up an organization and how those elements inter length enabling the organization to effectively achieve its current and future objectives it provides the principles standards and tools that enable an organization to manage complex change in the structured and agile way it so the uncle guy talks to a number of different kinds of architecture types talks about business architecture which allows the organization's capabilities to compared with its strategy to identify gaps service architecture is a view of all services as interactions between services that's a very very important part of service architecture is the interaction between those services information systems architecture which is the view of logical and physical data and if information assets of the organization including how they're shared and managed i would actually also say that's the interaction between those is very very important on information systems as well particularly when you're looking at things like user directories or things like that that are the backbone or the foundation of of the rest of the information systems technology architecture this is the software and hardware infrastructure of their organization and then lastly environmental which is all the external factors affecting the organization and environmental control could include a pest analysis we've already talked about that this is quite close to some of the environmental factors that we talked about but these be the external ones as opposed this would include sort both the external factors as as well as yet i would say that we'd wanna consider some of those enterprise factors as well i think the way it talked about this it would consider those the enterprise environmental factors be more on the business architecture side because they wanna reserve the word environmental for the environment of the context outside of the organization let's take a look at the practice considerations here when certain new services are being developed or existing services are being changed architect management can help provide a blueprint now information support effective decision making alright so not a a really important first step or a great way to get started just to identify what information already exists and also how fresh is is it is it is it up to date there might already be defined roles or information knowledge bases of around these different architectures and need to make sure that that architecture management is made part of how the organization makes decisions and that it can provide the right input at the right time for those for those decisions part of all of this is strategy and planning in a huge part of that is to make sure you the right alignment across organizations the right alignment across these different kinds of architectures but also to reduce waste by having of best the best plans we can given the information that we have next we'll take a look at information security management what our it guide has is that this that that the purpose of the information security management practice is to protect the information needed by their organization to conduct its business this includes understanding and managing risks to the confidentiality integrity and availability of information as well as other aspects of information security such as authentication and non making sure that someone can't deny that they token an action this about auditing so let's take a look at what the practices of information security looks like well lots of things here policies processes behaviors risk management controls now controls has three section of three parts to it prevention detection and correction so security is always about balancing the protecting of the organ organization with a pragmatic approach of keeping its secure i mean of course the most secure server is the one that's not connected to the is it's the one that has no power but that's gonna have least functionality and security is always a balance between the functionality needs and security needs for example if the controls you put in place are overly restrictive and staff will just void them or find a backdoor door or a workaround which will actually create more risk than having a looser control that has better compliance it's a very important part of of all security implementation particularly across an organization so let's take a closer look at those controls wanna make sure that we all have the shared understanding of what those three kinds of controls are defined in our uncle guide prevention is making sure that security incidents don't happen detection means that when they do happen we wanna be able to be able to know about them quickly and reliably and the corrections is how do we intervene and then recover from those incidents so information security management is something that is gonna be important for every department every part of every organization now we are all connected we all have our computers we all connect to cloud services we all have mobile devices often that are provided by their organization or with a by bring your own device program that you have to be able to connect with vpn or other authentication services for example so given that you know technological controls can be used like demanding or putting into a policy for two factor authentication for example but the most important thing is you know culture again and you know how you educate and how do you in age people to model and use of the the best behaviors they're are gonna protect the organization age many security breaches are not about a technology thing but they're through social engineering by tricking someone or or having somebody with privileges take an action that covert gives access or something like that so you know being able to to test those things is just as important as implementing a policy like two factor authentication so for instance like people providing physical access with a key card or something like that or i know certainly i've been in workplaces where they send phishing attempt scam emails to see if to see if i correctly or see if the staff or he correctly responds to them and can provide guidance based on your reaction either praising and celebrating good security practices or providing a reminder to avoid those kinds of messages let's take a look at the practice considerations here so it's important that once again everyone feels like they're part security it's particularly for the management really really buys into this management backing is absolutely essential for information technology security in particular because there can be a lot of cultural change that's required so you're gonna see a pretty consistent theme that you know culture is so important and management's support the when you have leaders it's important that they lead in the direction they want the organization to go so cultural change is very difficult to do or it's typically difficult to do from a the bottom up path top down can be more effective ideally you want both you wanna make sure that people are unable to do the right thing have good information about why we're doing this and also understand the consequences if we don't practice good ip security the risks to the organization into our customers we wanna make sure that we're always thinking about security at the design stage of any service or product it's a little bit like accessibility for performance if you imagine how we build skyscrapers we always build the elevator shafts first and the rest of the building around them it'd be very expensive to do it with the other around earlier you get to thinking about that in your process the better next we'll take a look at knowledge management here we have the description we have in the book the purpose of knowledge management practice is to maintain and improve the effective efficient give convenient use of information and knowledge across the organization we don't so much have practices for this for this final knowledge management instead we talk about some benefits that when you use knowledge management you're gonna be able to structure things like defining knowledge billing knowledge than we're using and sharing it there's lots of different factors that will affect this practice a definitely a big part of the size and complexity of the organization as well as the size and complexity of the knowledge you need to to manage we could use paper records spreadsheets automated solutions things with search natural language processing knowledge bases communities discussion groups the ability to rate articles and and contributors all those kinds of things please keep in mind that knowledge is gonna be knowledge management is gonna be most effective when it's presented in context you have to leave and go somewhere else that's a very challenging cognitive task effective knowledge management you know is designed to make to help a person get the right information at the right time in the right way so yeah let's let's take a look at the practice considerations here mh you know this can be you know a a very ne area of service management knowledge exists in so many forms and so many places an organization bringing it all together and organizing all can really see daunting also keep in mind that too much knowledge too much information can be just as challenging or or difficult as too little you know look you know especially if you have an knowledge base that's filled with duplicate relevant incorrect information or out of date information but even worse in duplicate information is lots of slightly different variants with no clarity on which article or which source is the correct one karen feeding of a knowledge base or whatever the knowledge management solution is very important this isn't a throw things in once and then it'll all work out it's more really important to think of a knowledge management as a gardening task where you need to weed and cleared plant and and harvest all those kinds of things part of knowledge management is capturing information part of it is making sure that it's achievable but not part of it is making sure the nation isn't overwhelmed by content okay let's let's move on to the practice of measuring and reporting in our bug they write the purpose of the measurement reporting practice is to support good decision making by decreasing the levels of uncertainty this is achieved through the collection relevant data of various objects and the valid assessment of this data in an appropriate context managed objects include but are not limited to the products and services practices and value chain activities suppliers partners in the organization as a whole so what we see in this sec is that metrics are gonna be driven by some key things profit growth what's our competitive advantage how are we doing on customer retention but also compliance and things like a web accessibility data privacy if you're in financial or health care there's a a large number of of additional compliance by jurisdiction that are typically industry regulations there's lots of ways to to manage metrics and it's important that you have many different bubbles from high level organized organization objectives them of lower level operational tactical metrics for teams organizations need to also be continually reviewing their metrics so this reflects back on that first practice of continual improvement we need to make sure that they're not driving poor behavior or creating the wrong effect so we need to think about things like key performance indicators that's you know a way of saying here's here's a a goal that we have and we we'll we'll know that we're successful when we're achieving these indicators so we wanna be able to tie our data to those things so we're able to make sure that we're collecting the right data we wanna make sure that data's is presented with that purpose in mind and that end to inform and typically support decision making or at least some sort of prioritization the book talks about making sure that we look at critical success factors csf and key performance indicators kpis i've ways to for an organize tools for organization to assess the performance gates original goals keys heat success sorry critical success factor is defined as a necessary pre condition for the achievement of intended results and kpis are an important metric use value to success in meeting and objective at being said there some definite risk in how we use metrics so the book refers to good harvest law which is excellent and it says when a measure becomes a target it cease to be a good measure so an example from the british healthcare care system where they were it was reported that people at emergency and we're waiting a long time more than thirty minutes for first contact and the outcome of that report was the introduction of basically receptionist and then we were able to change the result by making sure that the first contact was within minutes however the the measurement was not actually being used here the target did not think through the actual value and people weren't looking to be set hello to they wanna be triage and know that they're gonna be taken more care of and that they're in line to see a medical staff that'll would be one example this cartoon here also talks about the other way another cute example of of how you can get the wrong result when measurements become a target so the practice considerations for measurements is that we we need to see what's happening now you know in the past you know a reporting was on a very long cycle maybe it included be printing and finding them and maybe people didn't actually look at them now we we're looking for things to be just in time or available very quickly i would really encourage you to think about working out in the open continuous reporting with available on demand as a pole and instead up a push i don't mean that you have to have reporting available every second but that you work out that your team works determines an appropriate cadence for updating your your recording weekly maybe and that other people in organization are able to go to a dashboard for instance that's electronically available on the web or on your internet so they can get the information when whenever they need it plus you wanna be putting analytics on that report so that that dashboards you understand ideally how frequently people are going there is there a peak time through the year or a quarter who's going there in things like that using reporting and dashboard you make performance visible and really help to make sure everyone's on the same page and ideally that your encouraged communication and collaboration between teams there's a book called the goal by em gold i definitely have called the goal theory of constraints i strongly recommend the book i love this quote i've used this quote in other presentations or or other other courses for sure with it's tell me how you measure me and i'll tell you how it behaves right measurement is so important because it's gonna shape how people respond to the constraints of the organization okay let's move on to organizational change management what we have in the book is the purpose of organizational change management practice is to ensure that changes in an organization are smoothly and success implemented and that lasting benefits are achieved by managing the human aspects of changed and that last part is so important so we do have a sam of activities here creating a sense of urgency we need to make sure people are ready to make these changes and don't delay them it's important to think to make sure that an organization typically is only looking at one thing to change at the time there's one change management model that talks about how your everyday works feels like a whirlwind and so if you could hit your team or your organization to focus on one thing outside of the whirlwind that's that's pretty great it's very common organizations to have very ambitious goals of three or three to five ten major organizational changes all at the same time the literature really suggests that taking on one organizational change at the time is a very strong pattern for success of course we need to make sure that those changes are aligned with stakeholder expectations you'd be able to communicate we need to empower the people in the organization to be able to actually go make those changes through the right alignment but also not having to check in all the time there's going to be resistant so part of any organizational change needs to address how we're gonna manage that resistance that need to be able to reinforce that change when we say change in organization keep in mind that this is gonna affect people it's gonna affect how they work how they behave in their role and in that could be a very positive thing for people i could also be perceived as very negative we really wanna make sure that we've clear and relevant objectives for each change that leadership is strongly committed that we've prepared our participants the the people in our organization out there that they're willing and excited about the change and that we're achieving sustained improvement and building momentum on past changes for future it's really important that our organizational change isn't something that an external supplier is accountable for certainly you could bring in experts to help with that kind of change but with any kind of organizational change but the the accountability for that organizational change management needs to stay within the organization in terms of practice considerations what we see here is that this is about is that the whole idea of organizational change management is definitely evolving in the digital world and things are able to be so flexible and changed so quickly that we're really seeing the idea of permanent state of change or or continuous evolution rather than a series of projects the it book reviews the c or eight step organizational change model and the freeze change model but actually in the next unit we're gonna cover both of those in quite quite a bit more detail than our ideal guide so you definitely take a look at them here but we'll we'll take a closer look at them in the next unit here's a great quote by antoine sent ex pepe we're the little prince but i love this i love this quote a goal that a plan is just a wish i really appreciate it in this section the it guide had some really great in inspirational quotes to help tie together the the ideas and the importance of what they're talking about next we'll take a look at portfolio management here from the it guide the purpose of the portfolio management practice is to ensure that the organization has the right mix of programs projects products and services to execute the organization strategy within its funding and resource constraints lots happening in that one really good definition here you know are the work we're doing is the work we're doing align with our strategy and our capacity really great definition so lots of different activities here you know portfolio management is all about making strategic decisions that are gonna balance organizational change and business as usual a little bit like what's that one big thing we're gonna to do while we're also managing the whirlwind these activities include you know developing and applying a framework this will allow you to to define and deliver a portfolio of products services projects to support your organization strategies and goals we need to define products and services and link them to agreed outcomes we need to evaluate and prioritize our product services our projects and our change poll i really like they include chains for proposals in that list because we we can only do so much as as an organization and if we're gonna do embark on some kind of organizational change that mute necessarily needs to be the deduction from the other work we're doing which is typically products service or project implementing this strategic investment appraisal and decision making process for portfolio decisions and then analyzing and tracking our investments to make sure that we see where we're getting value for our resources and and our investments so and that investment isn't just money it's also time energy people attention engagement and where is it not paying off words it's not paying off can we remediate that is there an you can do to improve that or should we stop doing it and keep in mind that sunk cost fallacy that we don't wanna throw good money after bad not is the time just to cut okay and then we also have we need to monitor the performance of the portfolio and of course it just or adapt to the changing priorities in needs of their organization and then lastly we need to make sure we're regularly reviewing the overall portfolio to assess our progress outcomes cost risk benefits and strategic contributions in terms of practice considerations you know portfolio management relies on accurate information to be successful so we really need to make sure that information is not getting out of date the practice needs to be ongoing so you see a lot of like a lot of the what i'd i love about this idea of practices is that they're continuous they're ongoing there it's not a process with an input and output they're iterative they benefit from momentum alignment we were wanna make sure that portfolio management is part of you know the full life cycle of our products and services all the way through to retirement remember products and services won't last forever there it comes a time where we're going to end of life them and put them on the shelf it's also very dangerous likewise to only look at new services we you know if we're not continually evaluating our our the outcomes the success of our end market offerings especially if they're older you know the their profitability or the value of customer customer could definitely change over time and it would you know important to either adapt those services or retire them and potentially replace them with a newer offering key all that requires portfolio manage to be very well aligned and have a very good understanding strategic strategic objectives of the organization we're not gonna be able to align our portfolio and each item in the portfolio to the business objectives of the organization if our portfolio management practice does not have a very clear understanding of the strategic objectives of the organization next stop is project management so we've got a ton of work on project management in the book they the describe this so as the you know the purpose of project management practice is to ensure that all projects in the organization are successfully delivered this is achieved by planning del monitoring and maintaining control of all aspects of a project and keeping the motivation of all the people involved really important to note that for till project is quote a temporary structure that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more outputs or products according to an degree business case end quote so this is there's some really interesting parallels there but also you know some nuance differences from the pm definition that we saw on the pin block the guy talks about waterfall and agile it's different methods for delivering projects you know they observe that water is well suited when all the requirements are are known and the definition of the work is more valued than this speed of the delivery so you know that problem is a larger investment or a more complex multi party investment potentially agile works when the requirements are uncertain or likely to change in where speed is more important or prioritized over definition of precise requirements yeah i we've spent a lot of time talking about waterfall so i won't go into that anymore here i think we have a good understanding for that in terms of practice considerations they do a really good job here saying you know why your projects fail you know if you don't know what your objective is if you not resource correctly or if changes to scope or deadlines any part of a triple constraint are not well managed then you're gonna have a very hard time being successful with that project keep in mind that you know sometimes employees feel really torn between business as usual that day to day operations with what i also who refer to as the role in in a project definitely an organizational chain would probably be presented as project work so it's important that not only you have clarity on that but you know a you people reporting to you that you're providing that kind of clarity on how to prioritize operational or business usual work and project work next we'll take a look at relationship management our book writes that the purpose of the relationship management practice is to establish and nurture the links between the organization and its stakeholders at strategic and tactical levels it includes the identification analysis monitoring and continue improvement of relationships with in between stakeholders the it book has a number of relationship management outcomes these are that stakeholder needs and motivations are understood and this is essential for effective prioritization we that the other outcome is that stakeholder satisfaction will be high that there's a constructive relationship between the organization and stakeholders to keep in mind that stakeholders can be internal and external the the next outcome is that customer priorities are established while articulated and aligned with our business outcomes next products and services facilitate value creation for service consumers and the organization next the organization's facilitating value for all stakeholders and then lastly the conflicting stakeholder requirements are identified mediated relationship management needs to include all the relevant stakeholders many organization focus on consumers and customers but make sure we don't forget about suppliers partners employees all of them are significant practice considerations for relationship management is you know often it's seen as something we need to do for a quick fix when customer satisfaction is low it really needs to be something that's proactive and involved earlier once again we see the theme of practice is being continuous and ongoing and iterative it's really important that relationship management is presented in a way that is gonna be neutral and fair if if your customer believes that the way you meant relationship if it's always in favor your organization then they're not gonna trust and they're not gonna engage relationship management staff have a very high need to be ethical and responsible and i would especially say transparent that is a true statement for all staff members but the risks associated with drift from those values for the relationship management team are particularly high especially considering that they often will have to deliver a an unpleasant message to a customer but it's better to provide a hard truth and and move through that conflict and resolve it than to mislead either party keep in mind that you know it's not necessarily your customers drive to be it experts and they might have a lot of trouble even articulating the problem so relationship management people people who are involved in that work often need to be very good at being able to translate between the more technical side and the more customer facing side next let's take a look at risk management what we have in our book is that they write the purpose of the risk management practice is to ensure that the organization understands and handles risks effectively managing risk is essential to ensure the ongoing sustainability of an organization and creating value for its customers risk management is an integral part of all organizational activities and therefore central to an organizational service value system three key activities and risk management identify assess and then address risks i really really appreciate that the eye you got that the i feel guide points out that wow risk is often viewed as something negative it's also something that can be an opportunity and missing an opportunity or being unprepared for it is its own kind of special risk we wanna avoid those as well keep in mind that risk is just a part of biscuit part of business there's there's no enterprise no endeavor that we can undertake where there will be no risk and not all can be avoided that risk management must be consistent across the organization otherwise that week link in in the risk management chain throughout the old total whole organization will be a significant exposure and that risk management culture and behaviors are very important this lines up very similar very similar with it security and in part because i actually security is one very significant kind of risk that we need to manage take a look at the practice considerations for relationship management you know if leaders don't treat risk management's is important then the rest of the organization isn't going to see that's a priority either it's very important that leaders model the behavior and model the values that they seek for the the culture of the organization of organization they wanna see in the members of that organization very important that delivering bad news isn't punished though and not everything's gonna work out we're not perfect so things are gonna break we're gonna have outages are gonna down we're gonna make the mistakes and we need to be able to share that information that doesn't mean that there needs to be no accountability or responsibility but yeah we need to be able to talk freely about these things if we don't understand what the risk acceptance level of our organization is then we might not take enough risk or take unnecessary risks alright so let's take a look at service financial management what we have here from the book is the purpose of the service financial management practice this to support the organization's strategies and plans for service management by ensuring that the organization's financial resource investments are being used effectively this practice is described quite thinly i wish they put more in here i mean understandably this is something that typically another department would primarily own like the finance department or potentially hr in terms of staff costs against services but you know i really appreciate that they that they're saying that what we need to do is make sure that we take a look at the financials of each service and not just say of the it department as a whole they identify three key activities here budgeting or costing which is a focus on predicting and controlling income and expenditure within the organization although i think we're really too concerned of a controlling income accounting is just making sure that we are under that we are recording and understanding how money is being spent but i also how a revenue is coming in and then lastly charging are we are we actually charging for the service we're delivering for and also is if we if we don't charge them and we're not make money but also we wanna make sure that our charges are accurate all the time in terms of practice considerations that they touch on this idea of some more you know that you know overall organizational financial management is is sufficient we need leave things there and they don't spend the time to invest in service financial management that probably isn't isn't the best way to do it service financial management allows you take those it service costs and break them down and really be able to look at the detail of each service and we can make better decisions around each of those next we'll take a look at strategy management our book has the purpose of strategy management practice is to formulate the goals of the organization and adopt the courses of action and allocation of resources necessary for achieving those goals strategy management establishes the organization's direction focuses effort defines and clarifies the organization's priorities and provides consistency or guidance in response to the environment the objectives of strat of strategy management are to analyze the organization's environment to identify opportunities to identify constraints that could have fact the business outcome decide and agree on the organization's perspective and direction including vision mission and principles to establish the organization's perspective and positioned with regards to customers and competitors to ensure the strategy is translated in the tactical and operational plans and to manage changes to the strategy and the documentation and communication of that strategy in keep in mind the strategy provides the overall direction for the organization is normally set up the senior management in governing body level strategy as a practice is now evolving become more fluid and less fixed changes in technology for example can quickly invalidate them five year plan so we're seeing organizations be more agile and it and have much more adaptive idea of their strategy you probably have heard the word pivot in this space i would say a good pivot is where you do not change your strategy or the vision like you but change the path route or technique that you'll use to to achieve that goal in terms of practice consideration you know it's this is a particularly hard one for people who are not in senior manager because it's typically who is setting the strategy for the organization you know authority and and leadership are really important elements to strategy but the other thing to keep in mind is that reactive strategies is really successful if you have a series of short term decisions that displace longer term strategy then you're not following your strategy you're not following the plan and you're not gonna end up where you are hoping to you your journey is gonna end in a different spot so if you always defer to customer requests your customer demands then you're not gonna follow your strategic road roadmap for your new future development for example okay let's talk about supplier management the it ideal guide rights the purpose of the supplier management practice is to ensure that the organization suppliers and their performances are managed appropriately to support the seamless provision of quality products and services this includes creating closer more collaborative relationships with key suppliers to uncover and realize new value and reduce the risk of failure we had a set of supplier management activities that include creating a single point of visibility and control to ensure consistency maintaining a supplier strategy and policy and also contract management information very very important that those contract details are not lost not easily accessible at any time especially if there is the reception or reports that the suppliers is not delivering what was in the contract negotiating in a green contract and arrangements managing relationships and contracts with internal and external suppliers keep in mind that the it department can often be an internal supplier with with a contract or an agreement and internal billing as as the transfer for fees and then lastly managing supplier performance there four key supplier strategies in terms of where your supplies come from or i'll also refer to as a sourcing strategy in the sourcing is when we use the resources that are an internal true organization outsourcing is going to an external supplier when you single source or if you have a partnership then what you're doing is you have a single supplier supplies all elements of the service or they act as a service integrator to manage other suppliers on half of the organization and then lastly if you have any combination of those or you can just have more than one supplier then we would refer that to that it's multi sourcing in terms of practice considerations what we have here that's very very important that you get a good start with your supplier management policy and this will set good expectations and you'll be able to build from there it's important to think about service integration and management and so this is also referred to as s i am or cy you know as organizations rely more and more suppliers this whole process is getting more and more complex it can be quite challenging to manage them all especially when things go wrong especially to if several things go wrong at the same time service integration and management is a methodology that uses a service integrator role to coordinate service relationships across suppliers service integration management might be done by staff within the organization or as an external organization so reflect on the last slide on the on those different us prior strategies or sourcing strategies and we talk about that partner that's definitely a si or an si option okay let's take a look at workforce and talent management the it guide writes the purpose of the workforce and talent management practice is to ensure that the organization has the right people with the appropriate skills and knowledge and in the correct role to support its business objectives the practice covers a broad set of activities focused on successfully engaging with the organization's employees and people resources including planning recruitment onboarding and learning and development performance measurement and succession planning whole lot going on in that one but the people of our organization are are the are the organization so it makes a lot of sense so we have some key terms here organization velocities defined as the speed effectiveness and efficiency with which an organization operates organizational velocity influences time to market quality safety costs and risks competencies are the combination of of folks sorry or the or the combination let me go back there we go competencies are the combination of observable and measurable knowledge skills abilities and attitudes that contribute to enhanced employee performance and ultimately result in organizational success are only as good as the people in your organization skills are a developer proficiency or dexterity and thought and verbal communication or physical action knowledge is the understanding of facts or information acquired by a person through experience or education the theoretical or practical understanding of the subject and then lastly we've have attitude which just a set of emotions beliefs and behaviors towards a particular object person think or event there are six activities i use these in a process because they're they're they don't only operate in this way and this isn't the only way you wouldn't necessarily have to do all of these but typically workforce planning that's how many seats are what how many people do we know need what what's the upcoming work do we need to increase or deep increase our seat count and if you're gonna increase your seat count alright how do you recruit those people what is our performance measurement how do we know people are being successful in their job how do we know when we need to support people to improve the performance and how we reward people with incentives for high performance also how are we investing in our people what what is their personal development how do we train them on an ongoing way and how do we up upscale them on an ongoing basis learning development is closely tying to personal development but typically happens more in a group environment personal development something that's gonna be typically more one on one with a manager or with a with a coach inside the organization learning and development is typically more like bringing in an instructor or subscription to something like o'reilly online learning and things like that and then lastly what's your mentoring in succession plan how are existing leaders in your organization helping support the development of new leaders and how are you setting up for the next generation of leadership in your organization because eventually the leaders of the of of the current leaders are gonna wanna retire and and move on and do something different in terms of practice considerations you know information technology service management professionals are typically referred to as knowledge workers and and this called in knowledge economy you know that the there's different ways of of new ways that are important to make sure that we're recruiting and and developing rewarding people some really good ideas what on what this might look like in in the book but it also we're keep in mind it depends on your organizational culture one of the things i really like about what this part of the book talks about is the shift away from the language of human resources to workforce in talent management more and more the idea that people are resources isn't really resonating and resources are more as things like money computers buildings things like that and the thinking is that we treat people as resources then they'll behave like resources the follow on to that is we treat them link talented individuals and we will create the best environment for them to behave like talented individual talented individuals and you can see this in the shift title from a our human resources to people and culture as something that is increasing more and more in in it and and and and beyond as well and that's the end of delivering general management practices
Unit 9 - Topic 2 - Part 1.webm: next we'll take a look at unit nine point two delivering service management practices once again we have a large number of these practices that will go through individually and we'll start off with availability management this is in the book it writes the that the purpose of the availability management practice is to ensure that services delivered greed services deliver agreed levels avail of availability to meet the needs to customers and users please note that availability is defined as the ability of an it service or other configuration item to perform its agreed function when required so i'm please as note that there's two important parts to that definition that that it's able to perform the agreed function when required okay let's take a look at the availability management activities our it ideal guide provides or lists five different activities here negotiating and agreeing targets for availability designing infrastructure and applications to meet the greet levels ensuring that service and component data is collected to measure availability monitoring analyzing and reporting on availability and lastly planning improvements to availability and that's it for the activities so we refer to measuring availability in this practice it's there's two important ways of measuring availability that's very valuable to be clear avail related to the frequency of service failure but also the time to recovery after that failure occurs there are two common ways to measure this mt mt f meantime between failure and mean meantime to restore service mt r s so that the measurement for mean meantime between failure is average time between outages please be very clear this does not include scheduled downtime it's calculated by taking the number of operational hours in dividing by the number of failures during a period by period i mean it when you say meantime before failure often it'll be on a on an annual basis but it could be any time period at all you know quarterly or monthly with the other common opportunities next we take a look at mt s meantime to restore service sometimes it's also referred to as mt t mean time to repair it just means how long does it take on average for breaks to be fixed and this is calculated by taking the number of hours of un schedule downtime and divided by the number of failures during the period it's very important to make sure that we have appropriate level of availability for each service you know this needs to be part of the service guarantee now that we have so much software as a service and cloud hosting there's been a really significant increase in the availability of services compared to say ten years ago there's a lot of different ways we could measure overall availability we wanna look beyond the meantime before failure and time to restore service other metrics are things like user outage minutes yeah which is the incident duration multiplied by the number of users affected that's another way of doing it number of loss transaction business value loss perhaps dollars so if you're a e commerce site then you know you might measure it in the number as million dollars or actual lost dollars of in progress transactions but also user satisfaction if you have fail or recovery mechanisms such as hot swap or high availability clustering or other things like that then we need to make sure that those are tested as part of the service availability planning you don't want a failure of occur and then at that time you discover that your hot fail or a clustered strategy does not work so in terms of practice considerations you know what we have here is that the the understanding what up or down means is not necessarily obvious this is an important conversation to have with stakeholders and we wanna make sure that we're we have a an explicit shared understanding ideally in writing at what up uptime and what downtime means and also what intermittent or degraded performance meets for instance if an outage is defined of any downtime of five minutes or more what if you had one hundred outages of four minutes in a row four minutes on one minute off sorry four minutes off one minute on four minutes off technically by the definition that you've provided for the service you don't have any downtime there's not an actual official downtime but clearly there's degraded performance and users cannot do their work so it's important to be clear on those differences we need to make sure that the service level management and relation management are all there in place to to integrate with availability management to make sure that we're having the right conversation with customers so that they they have the right expectations and are able to be confident in the services we're providing it's also significant to know that many customers will come to you with some availability number such as five nines or ninety nine point nine nine nine percent it's always important to validate why they come with that number but also to make sure they're understanding the costs associated with those things and in my experience ninety eight percent availability is pretty good for any sort of non high transaction non financial like non e commerce site and i i would very rarely sign off on going past three nines which is only a few hours of down half a year when we get into five nine that's minutes of downtime per year it's an extremely expensive proposition we wanna make sure that the cost benefit is there for for the customer also it's important that if you are providing very high levels of availability that you are appropriately costing it and making sure that the customer is is bearing that cost as part of the service because that's part of the value that your organization is delivering next we'll take a look at business analysis here we have from the i hill guide which states the purpose of the business analysis practice is to analyze a business or some element of it define its associate associated needs and recommend solutions to address these needs and or solve a business problem which must facilitate value creation for stakeholders business analysis enables an organize sensation to communicate its needs in a meaningful way express the rationale for change and design with in and design and describe solutions that enable value creation in alignment with the organization's objectives that's a a lot to get through but i was take a look at the activities maybe that'll help us better understand what that definition means which was a a little complicated seven different things here these activities are are described in our as analyzing business systems processes services and architecture identifying and prioritizing improvements to the service value system products and services identifying and prioritizing opportunities for innovation evaluating proposing actions to deliver improvements documenting business requirements to enable improvements and recommending solutions invalid with stakeholders you'll note there's something quite passive about all of these it's identifying evaluating documenting recommending but none of the doing and that's because this activity is just about the analysis this is about doing the research and putting together proposals and doing strategic analysis but it's not the actual doing so other things many of the other practices but in particular continue improvement be the kind of practice where we'd see the action part that the business analysis practice would develop in terms of practice considerations know it's very important that we acknowledge how transformative and influential agile has been in in it organizations and sometimes business analysis analysts have been replaced with product owners and other places or another option rather is to include them but rename them to put agile in their in their title and have them be closer aligned with a dev team whether that dev team delivers a code for a product or is it deli for an it service but whatever the name is having part of the organization that works on looking at business needs and identifying those opportunities for improvement is and it is critical to the success of organizations while technology is a is a powerful tool that can accomplish a lot business users may not know how to articulate their requirements and this kind of analysis brings together of those two worlds in a way that can help identify and then ideally achieve the value that's discovered through that business analysis practice next we'll take a look at capacity in performance management our ideal guide states that the purpose of the capacity performance management practice is to ensure that service us that services achieve greed and expected perform satisfying current in future demands in a cost effective way think it's interesting to they include future demand so that means that there's a that's how we talk about that capacity part so if we didn't have that future demand as part of this definition would be looking just at performance management activities capacity planning is extremely important especially for for large growing it services in my experience in the at a medium sized university we had very consistent student growth year over year and ensuring that our infrastructure particularly email and storage kept pace with that was was critical and of quite a significant part of our work on that infrastructure team that i was part of to make sure that we're on in the same page i told the defines performance as a measure of what is achieved or delivered by a assistant person team practice or service in terms of capacity and performance management activities we have two key ones the analysis and the the planning service performance is a a broad term that can be used to describe many different service actions and they it could take a a lot of different time based on what those what what the service performance and capacity planning activities are all performance relies on surface capacity which describes the maximum throughput of a surface or surface component capacity performance management activities can include things like service performance and capacity analysis and that as part of that we wanna make sure we're thinking about monitoring the current performance and and the service modeling but that ties directly to that kind of capacity planning that i was talking about so service performance capacity planning would be the other kind of activity that's included here that would need to consider requirements analysis demand forecasting so that's looking at europe for example in in the email and storage example i was talking about our demand forecast would take a look at what year over year growth what our actual were in terms of a per user utilization and then making sure we had the best data possible from the registrar to know how many new users we would expect within the time frame and then we would work out and look at what the accuracy of those forecasts were in the past to help us predict do we need to include a buffer or or or how accurate are they that all gives you what you need for resource planning in our case this was quite some time ago so it what we need to do this quite early in the year so september of course is the peak time for new students so we would be looking at in the spring once the initial university acceptance were released because we would have to buy servers rack them install the os and and install all the services on today the that would be more likely done in the cloud when you don't do that kind of work and you end up with poor capacity and performance management keep it abilities and you could that could have a very strong negative impact on customer satisfaction because your service performance will not be where it needs to be in terms of practice consideration it's very important to think about the pieces that are not technology policy procedures to government capacity very important so you know sometimes business sponsors like we'll get a request that we need more servers or or something like that and as we see more and more access to home computing more remote work continuing price drops and storage media that's end up with the just buy more space attitude from from business but there could be lots of other things like networking software licenses lot lots of things that all go into what that capacity plan it needs to be we need to look at more than just the purchase price of say something like start with the ongoing cost some something we might call tc c or total cost of ownership or lt lifetime cost of the housing maintenance backing up the data making sure we have enough media for those backups or the standard overhead square footage in our data center all those kinds of things some of those things definitely apply to cloud and local services or local servers in your own data center of course some of them like square footage wouldn't wouldn't be applicable to cloud next up is change enable our book writes that the purpose of the change enable practice is to maximize the number of successful service and product changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed authorizing changes to proceed in managing a change schedule and just so that we're all in the same page it defines a change as and the addition modification or removal anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on a service and i would say that that's a very good and very precise definition i would also say that the real world of pretty much any addition modification removal because it you it's very hard to to actually know for sure whether that change will have a direct or indirect effect on services until you actually remove it i've i certainly have been in situations where i'm at so we convinced that there's no way that those two things are connected and i've spun down a service or taken out of production for maintenance and things have broken and fallen apart because of that so making sure you the right rollback plan for any changes is very important i tell things about change as having three kinds standard normal and emergency those standard changes are low risk and they're always pre authorized that's how they our standard they're gonna be well understood there's gonna be the change plan will be documented an example might be giving new starter access to a piece of approved to giving a a new starter so i'm just doing organization access to a piece of approved software very very standards normal changes need to be scheduled assessed and authorized lower risk changes probably need less scrutiny than higher risk ones many organizations have a tool in place to manage a change request workflows auditing the process where it makes sense to do so you wanna be very careful with automating any kind of approval you wanna automate as much as the process as you can but the actual proof we wanna make sure that there's a response an accountable human behind clicking clicking the button checking the box and then the last kind of change that i things about is emergency change these need to be implemented as soon as possible almost always in response to a break issue or a security breach they're always need to be assessed and authorized but you know push come to shovel or in a in a tight situation you you're gonna do the best you can bring the service up right away that doesn't mean that you would do it by yourself without any any communication or authorization but if emergency protocols calls need to be very clear so that they are streamlined and made as efficient as possible in this kind of situation steps like testing might be left out temporarily and there often is a separate change authority for emergency changes part of that separate process or separate authority would be to be available twenty four seven for example assuming that your that you deliver services on an ongoing perpetual basis a little bit more about that change authority that that's the ideal term for the person or group that authorizes a change and change authority could be decentralized working in organizations that work at high speed in agile environments could be peer review for example oh it could be more centralized to change advisory board with documented proposed changes with an approval process in the schedule things like that that change schedules used to help plan changes but so not only assisting communication internally with our stakeholders with our customers but also to avoid conflicts you wanna make sure that you don't schedule two changes at the same time especially if they would interfere with each other okay let's take a look at the power practice resources for change management you know when you bring in formal change oversight it it it it could be very frustrating it can really feel like people are saying of being told they don't know how to do their job or something like that especially if the organization is operated for a long time without it it's really important that the benefits of change enable in communication are clearly indicated like it has the potential to help everyone and that'll it'll benefit you you won't no one will step on your maintenance so or anything like that our our book says that you only have one chance to introduce change enable and if if it fails and and you'll be met future efforts will be met with we tried that and was too bureaucratic or unaffected i i'm less pessimistic than that but i i do take their point that this is a a very important critical practice and you wanna perceive a caution diligence in and making sure that it is as successful as you can possibly make it keep in mind that understanding what the changes is very important you know the short there's is anything that could affect the service or a customer a change but you know once again the an important strategy or a useful strategy and winning people over or getting them on assigned to this kind of processes by talking about how it protects them the the engineer or the the technician just as everyone else so that if a change goes wrong the organization will be able to look at the change enable process not that one person of that one person or the one one person's team in that would be wholly responsible for okay next up we'll take a look at incident management here we have the purpose of the incident management practice is to minimize the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible and just to be clear until defines an incident as an unplanned interruption to or a reduction in the quality of the service there are three incident management activities to design the process prioritize the incidents and document the incidents it is so critical that all incidents are documented if they may be logged and prioritized and resolve according to whatever the service level agreement or or for the stakeholder agreement is often incidents need to be escalated to a support team for that resolution that might be because of very particular special skills or schedule rotational schedules or things like that incident management needs to include quality timely updates to the effective users which requires a high level of collaboration between teams this is a really important time to put customer first and put aside our own any of frustrations or friction or whatever to make sure that we get to that incident being resolved as soon as possible in terms of designing the incident management practice this of the we need to react appropriately to different kinds of incident types so depending on their impact major and major incidents and security incidents might require special handling we course to prioritize or triage them we to make sure that the incidents with highest impact and urgency are addressed first so those classifications and timescale scales need to be understood and communicated with our consumers and then we need to use some kind of incident management tool to log and manage those incidents so that they're all documented it could provide a link changes linked to known errors and knowledge articles might also provide into the matching and and links to problems as well in terms of practice considerations what we see here is that as i was as i was mentioning before so important that we don't have barriers between teams during incident management of course we don't want barriers between teams time but the stakes are especially high when you're dealing with incident management because typically the clock is ticking and we have frustrated users who can't use the tool that they're paying for and that's the value we're delivering so making sure that we have good prior about good understanding of what incidents are what the time scales are what the priorities are or are so important to make sure that we can just get down to the work of resolving the issue infinite management is a really great place for automation and there's lots of quite mature tools for this we wanna make sure that we're looking at how they integrate in particular things like integration with phone systems out pocket fields and and really great reporting one thing that is often a challenge for our organizations is how much categorization and incidents to introduce i i the book gives us advice and i strongly supported to keep it simple and have quite a bit of control on which roles can add more categories sometimes people wanna sort of create every possible use case for the categories i say start with the minimum and make sure that you're not trying to solve a problem but doesn't exist so if if if you wanna set up you know two hundred different categories of or ten categories or twenty sub subcategories reach or whatever the scenario is you're trying to what you're trying to do there or what what i've seen in that situations an attempt to create a problem for what we need to make sure that we're accurately classify each incident and that that's absolutely true but what if we just started with those ten and then waited to see the problem the hypothesis is ten may not be enough and when we have evidence when we invalidate the hypothesis that we need more then we can go and start sub even that i'd be very cautious as how i did that in quite slow to make sure that we're strongly validating the need for any additional category because the overhead the lifetime cost of a more complex system makes everything harden every interaction with that system more complex next up is it asset management the purpose isn't so the our it guide or right that the purpose of it asset management practice is to plan and manage the full life cycle of all it assets to help the organization maximize value control costs manage risk support decision making about purchase reuse retirement and disposal assets meet regulatory and contractual requirements it defines it assets as any financially valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an it product or service i think by that definition we might include a coffee maker or at least in the offices that i worked in in i also wanna share that the book outlines three kinds of asset management and that's it asset asset management referred to as it software asset management referred to as sam in hardware asset asset management referred to as net as ham i've also seen network that'd be part of this as well but those are three excellent options in terms of the it asset management activities it's activity tight sorry we have hardware software cloud and client so for hardware assets this would include activities like labeling location tracking life cycle management so that we know when that new new components are coming in then we're retiring things and how we dispose to them particularly keep in mind any relevant regulations or legislation that would particularly be around data privacy to storing hard drives through d d digitization or drilling them through but also environmental requirements as there's quite a number of toxic elements that are go into electronic or digital electronic equipment for software assets these the activities would be things like protection from unlicensed use tracking of licenses but also life lifecycle management life cycle management understanding how many users you have what the total number of seats purchased our making sure then you understand or you're approaching if you're at risk of running out of seats but also when of the renewal for the where that contract is for cloud based assets the activities include things like role management for users to make sure that you only have authorized access to the cloud license and information security management but also cost management everything on cloud based assets typically are based on a consumption models so the more you use it the more you get charged so for instance developers keeping an instance running up overnight when no one's using it is a needed cost so that's the kind of thing that they're talking about there in terms of client assets this is for instance if you have material in your data center that are owned by a client but i've also seen situations where you put hardware on a client site we wanna make sure that we know who owns the asset life lifecycle management and the matter of data on client devices in terms of it asset management activities overall we have defining which is populating maintaining the asset register we need to make sure we're providing storage facilities for assets really good medium that we're controlling asset life cycles providing reports and data about assets as required in auditing assets as required as well ensuring that we provide the data for external auto in terms of the practice consideration asset management is a practice with a very strong business case this practice can save an organization a lot of money by identifying unused resources in particular but also making sure that you are only growing in a just in time way as mentioned the introduction of cloud services created some new challenges for service management professionals some of them now some of those professionals now sit with the cloud services provider but cost management information security and especially i success management still sit within the client organization there's lots of training out there in with certification and in general they're they're worth it and we'll pay for themselves back quite quickly the return on investment is usually quite good and typically something that is paid for us perpetual development by organization next we'll take a look at monitoring and event management our ideal guide writes that the purpose of the monitoring and event management practice is to systematically observe services and service components and record and report selected changes of state identified as events this practice identifies and prioritizes infrastructure services business processes and information security events and establishes the appropriate response to those events including responding to conditions that could lead to potential faults or incidents so that sounds a little bit like our performance and capacity planning for it till an event is defined as any change of state that has significance for the management of a service or other configuration item events are typically recognized the notifications created by an it service configuration item or monitoring tool part of what this practice does is manage events through their life cycles to prevent minimize or eliminate the negative impact that they might have this practice is about observing services and servers components and and ensuring that we're able to detect any potentially significant change or condition now that would as we said negatively affect the service this is almost always accomplished through automation event management focuses on recording and managing the outputs from monitoring that are classified as events each event will be assessed in the credit control action initiated control action could be do nothing that's a very common continue monitoring or initiate another practice like incident management to be clear not all the outputs from monitoring become events it ideal things of events as having as being three types informational warning and exception informational is defined as events that for which no action is required but could be part of a trend or data analysis a warning is an action needs to be taken to avoid a negative impact and but an exception is action required negative business impact might already have occurred so a warning an exception basically are or about the same except in terms of the time frame that they reference warning is predicting a negative impact and exception says that such a thing has already happened in terms of monitoring and event management activities we have five different activities here identifying what to monitor implementing and maintaining monitoring establishing and maintaining thresholds and criteria to identifying class five events establishing and maintaining policies for event management and implementing an improving process as an automation for monitoring an event management while automation is a huge part of this practice human intervention is still essential this is another theme and what we're seeing in the service management we need to have a mix of built in monitoring capabilities and service components monitoring tool they maybe they become provided by the vendor or something that custom built by the it team but ultimately human intervention and oversight the entire process is critical for the long term success of this practice in terms of practice considerations when you're starting to set this up it's very important to start in a simple way and then add to them as the practice matures this isn't a time to to i put in the kitchen sink this is quite similar to the category example that i was just talking about in the previous practice you don't wanna start with all the things you wanna make sure that you start with the minimum number of required things and then validate the hypothesis that that delivers value to the organization or sufficient value at the an acceptable cost and then grow it from that point it's important that the success of monitoring an event management is something that's shared throughout the organization because what we're doing here is proactively monitoring and ideally preventing incidents it's before they occur one interesting risk is that the successes of that could be rarely seen out of outside the operations team if if we're stopping problems before they have but no one knows then no one will understand or stakeholders will not understand that the very important and valuable work that the operations team is doing with their monitoring in the event management next we'll take a look at problem management defined as the purpose of problem management is to reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents and managing workarounds and no errors to be clear a problem is a cause or potential cause of one normal incidence so typically what you'd see is an incident get reported if it's a new incident then we'll start doing a root cause analysis and that'll help us get to the problem resolving the incident may or may not resolve the problem and a series of incidents that all point to the same problem would give us the right prioritization to make sure that it's being addressed problems require investigation and analysis to identify their causes and recommend a long term resolution however there's an intermediate step there that might be just to develop a workaround around i till finds a workaround as a solution that reduces or eliminates the impact of an incident or problem for which a full resolution is not yet available some workarounds reduced in likelihood for an instance so any workaround needs to be documented in the problem marker and then reviewed and approved as the problem analysis analysis progresses so early on in the iterative process of problem resolution but we may identify a workaround and share that but as we continue to work on a more permanent or longer term solution we need to make sure that we're updating the documentation workarounds could be as simple as asking a user to least our computer or could be as complicated as a a multi step alternative path that gets to the same place but it's not as not as smooth the user experience at which would not be pleasant but would still allow the work to be done known errors need to be documented and made available to other practices such as the service desk problem management has three phases identifying the problem controlling the problem that error control problem identification is gonna include things like trend analysis of the data at including incident reports remember i was talking but if we have multiple incidents at i'll point to the same problem detecting recurring issues this could be something like looking at error logs is is it one common way of doing that identifying when whether major incidents might re occur if the incident happens due to a system overload for instance if you're getting h http g p five hundred five zero one return codes because the service is simply unavailable that that could be over capacity service so for instance there like one o'clock is a common time one one thirty for email servers potentially experience that because everyone's back for lunch it's a the peak use of time during the day also we need to work with suppliers and partners and analyze information developers testing and project teams problem control is an activity that includes things like analysis prioritization in making decisions based on the relative risk of of the problem or the different options we could document workarounds and document known own errors not just because we know there is an error doesn't mean we'll fix it that is ideal but sometimes it's not possible or it's simply doesn't the the business case to fix it is not sufficient for instance if it's a very expensive fix it's a very low utilization feature and there's a sufficient workaround that that's the kind of scenario where you might see a problem left unresolved air control includes things like identifying potential permanent solutions making sure that we manage and and reassess our unknown errors on a regular basis and we also look at management we assessment ideally improvement of workarounds but hopefully the transformation of a resolution from a workaround to a solution and it's very important to keep in mind that problem management is gonna interface with many other practices such as change enable and incident management service desk things like that okay let's take a look at the practice considerations here it's a very important that this is viewed as a point of coordination for the investigation and the resolution of problems if this role is gonna work with multiple support teams gonna ensure the investigation is gonna be sensible as possible and the actions are documented so that we're not gonna have duplicated work a lot of organizations have find it challenging to understand the difference between incidents and problems it's very very important that we're able to clearly define this and communicate the the difference between who's two practices to be clear just because an incident is is long lived doesn't make it a problem service management tools can really improve the performance and usefulness of of of management when workarounds are easily searchable and problems can be linked to incident records then the practice were work well if if that's a difficult or challenging process then the the staff typically won't be engaged or invested in it in problem management won't deliver sufficient value next we'll take a look at release management here we have from our book the purpose of the release management practice is to make new and changed services and features available for users i really really like this definition of release from it tel which is a version of a service or other configuration item or a collection of configuration items that is made available to the user it's like anything that's a made made available to the user so what is a release so that was a really nice broad definition but what what are the specific thing we would see as being here well as you can see on this slide a lot of different things it could be a service it could be put a piece of infrastructure our documentation changes in processes all kinds of things we could have minor releases we had have major releases or we could even have new services or new products it's important that we're communicating what the release is and why it's happening through something called a release plan and that should include a a description of of what the release will include all of its components and the timing and schedule of the release after the release of post implementation review is carried out to identify learning and improve how we improve that particular release but also the overall release process of the organization please keep in mind that release management activities will be very different in waterfall and pat agile environments taking a look at practice considerations it's often the case that once once something's ready to go the organization has get really impatient about shipping it but getting it out the door things like testing training and documentation might be left to the side really isn't acceptable and it's not gonna set you up or or your stakeholders up but definitely not your consumers up for success another common challenge group with release management is when you have multiple external suppliers involved in the delivery of a service is really important that all those suppliers align with your release policies and in schedules as well so there's an idea called early life support which is what happens with with brand new of and this is for larger more costly releases you wanna make sure that the first two weeks for example when something is released that there's a can have a lot of support but be we also just wanna make sure that the extra resource is brought to a new released ensure that it's successful don't aren't withdrawn just because it's been fourteen days or pen business things or whatever and there needs to be a very clear measurement of service performance that indicates when it is time for that early life support to be wound down and have that service or product move to steady state next we'll take a look at service catalog management so the purpose of the service catalog management practice is to provide a single source of consistent make sure all services and service offerings this is a list of services that are available to customers and the catalog might be a document or a spreadsheet could be portal or a very sophisticated tool now the important functionality is that if it's easy for users to look up the information about each what's available i will also comment that i i've been out of this kind of project a few times like rarely seen it be very successful it's a very thing and quite expensive overall and and be challenging to be successful if and our book doesn't have much information on it it's a it's a very thin section our guy talks about three service catalog management activities publishing updating and customize when you look at that customizing part what and this is my language that i was trying to trying to summarize what they have here is they talk about different views of that a service a lot of things like user reviews that shows information with the services how to request them custom reviews where as service level financial performance data it to it custom reviews where there's technical information security information and process information and then our a request catalog of that shows servers request associated with the services yeah it could even allow the request for new services at least new to that customer in terms of practice consideration it says it's hard to implement service catalog and once it's been implemented it's hard to keep that information today so this is the kind of challenge that i was talking about to be successful here the very first thing that you need to do is be really clear on what a services is and that's little harder to to to know and can be even different between customers sometimes making sure that you're aligned with to your customers so starting up asking them what they think is a service or what do you think our services are would be
Unit 9 - Topic 2 - Part 2.webm: next is service configuration management our it ideal guide has the purpose of the service configuration management practice is to ensure that accurate and reliable information about the configuration of services and the configuration items that support them is available when and where it is needed this includes information on how configuration items are configured and the relationship between them it goes on to define configuration item as any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an it service so we haven't talked about configuration items very much so far in this course the terms come a couple times when you're on the ground doing it till especially as part of a system administration's team configuration items or cis come up a lot but it's really important to keep in mind that these configuration configurations can be literally anything it's such a broad term i think of configuration items as the smallest or the atomic object or unit in tel that everything is composed of configuration items to build services and products and as you can see by the list here there's a number of things that could be a configuration item and it it even goes beyond what's on this list so to manage all of these configuration items it's easy to have hundreds thousands are being hundreds of thousands of a a truly large organization that have millions of configuration items in total so it's very important that we think about how to properly manage this information so that you can collaborate and have a single source of truth that system of record for all of this ci information and the solution for that is technology called cms a configuration management system not to be confused with a content management system which has the same acronym and is used typically for websites things like wordpress or would be examples of content management systems the it tool guide defines a configuration to management system as a set of tools data and information that is used to support service configuration management ideally the cms will be part of the same tool set or interfaces or the tools used by their practices as incident management and change enable so this is one of the places where we see an intersection between multiple practices in having a single system of record just for all of these different practices to share can be very advantageous to when selecting or when understanding or assessing cms you have to be in you must ensure for it to be successful that it's gonna be able to identify new configuration items and add them to the cms update configuration data whenever changes are made verify that those records are correct in audit application and infrastructure that identify any undocumented cis this definitely could use things like us s and m v set were simple network mapping protocol or other tools like that to auto discover things like network nodes router switches servers and other devices like that workstations but keep in mind how broad the ci definition is and that many of your ci will not be discover will by machines in terms of practice configuration it's very very important that we see how important service configuration management is because it informs and supports pretty much everything else we do if you don't have visibility and an inventory of the different configuration items that you need for service delivery then how can you know what state they're in or ensure that they're available or know how to improve them that being said the reality is that this information is often incomplete it does feel very complicated in the business case sometimes does not feel sufficiently clear so we part of that is because the business case for service configuration management is always focuses on indirect process benefits rather than effect so what configure service configuration management enables is are things like faster time to resolution for incidents fact better impact analysis or dependency analysis for potential changes and that and being able to provide clear records on duty cycles and time to time for replacement for hardware and other things like that typically you're not gonna see configuration service configuration management be on its own in terms of setting up systems for it as said it's typically gonna be set up with other services service practices such as change enable and release management okay service continuity management our it ideal guide states that the purpose of the service continuity management practice is to ensure that the availability in performance of a service are maintained at sufficient levels in the case of a disaster the practice provides a framework for building organizational resilience with the capability of providing an effective response that safeguards the interest of key stakeholders in the organization's reputation brand in value creating activities quite a generic or abstract definition we need to make sure that we can deliver what we need to deliver that's a the the simple version but let's also make sure that we're clear on what a disaster is as opposed to an incident or a problem our it guide quotes the business continuity institute in that in defining it as disaster as a sudden unplanned event that causes a great damage or serious loss to an organization it results in an organization failing to provide critical business functions for some predetermined period of time so you can see one of the things in there that each organization is gonna make a decision on what constitutes a definite definition disaster because you need to quantify great damage or serious loss you need to be able to categorize your functions as critical and non critical and also determine the length of time or the period that the outage is required to qualify as a disaster you can imagine that operation like paypal or shopify would have a very high bar for this because any significant interruption on counted in minutes is probably millions of dollars in actions if we look at a library then we could probably have a much longer time period and what's considered a critical function is probably very different it's but also if you looked at health care or a aero we could see that you know extremely small seconds could count as a disaster depending on the critical of the service involved when we think about what could cause a disaster the kinds of things that are listed in our book our supply chain failure terrorism whether cyber attack political events anything that affects an organization stakeholders and impact their and their impact are are included and you know those kinds of outcomes would be things like loss of income reputation damage breach richer regulations or fines loss of market share or ins inc so there's some key terms in in service continuity rt t is a recovery time objective that's defined as the maximum acceptable period of time following a service disruption that can lapse before the lack of business functionality severely impacts the organization so this is the that predetermined time we're just talking about this represents the maximum agreed time within which a product or an activity must be resumed or resource must be recovered notice that agreement there so stakeholders and service level agreements are are definitely part of this conversation and those practices intersect with this one recovery point objective rp the point to which information used by an activity must be restored to enable the activity to operate on res when you're doing disaster recovery plans part of it is to understand what your recovery point objective is and that's gonna be looking at things like backups red or hot swap resources a disaster recovery plan is a set of clearly defined plans related to how an organization will recover from a disaster well as returned to a pre disaster condition considering the four dimensions of service management and then lastly we have business impact analysis bi as which is a key activity in the practice of service continuity management that identifies vital business functions sometimes referred to it v f's but i think that's for me that's getting a little bit too much on the acronyms and their dependencies these dependencies may include suppliers people other business processes and it services business impact analysis defines the recovery requirements for it services these requirements include rt pto rp at a minimum target service level for it service in terms of practice considerations you know service continuity management typically is not something that's seen this mission critical or for young organizations if they're still trying to understand what their value is and establish their practices and processes but as organizations become more mature than there's often a shift to investment on this kind of practice we in that in part that's because as you continue to grow typically you have growing rep tension and more capital and costs tied up in your organization which means your risks are increasing as you grow as an organization therefore service continuity makes more and more sense it's also possible that you'll achieve a certain threshold number of employees number of transactions amount of money and ear things like that that would now make you subject to new requirements or regulations around record keeping or up uptime and things like that it's important to know that often or a common pattern is to see service continuity management a kick kick off with a lot of enthusiasm and energy with an organization continuity and but sometimes it can quickly diminish it's it's hard work and there's a a lot of effort and when there's nothing when nothing's on fire it can be hard to motivate or keep motivation up and engagement up for these activities it's actually a a good idea to try to get funding to start this gonna process directly after a significant disruption or potentially a disaster because the business will have a very clear idea of what's at stake and what the value is to to plan for this kind of to to have a service continuity e plan or disaster recovery plan the level of commitment to service continuity management will always be linked to the type of organization the markets and what they operate so finance health care defense telecommunications any the highly regulated or or work lives our our at stake are gonna have higher engagement with this kind of practice if you're running a game on your app phone then you know the downtime can be easily quantifying dollars but there might be something that's easier to alternatives that are more palatable or or acceptable to the organization next we'll take a look at service design our ideal guide states that the purpose of the surface design practice is to design products and services that are fit for purpose fit for use and that can be delivered by the organization and its ecosystem this which i would say is fit for organization this includes planning and organizing people partners suppliers information communication technology practices for new or changed products and services and the interaction between the organization and its customers what are the benefits of service design management well there's a number of options here but let's start up by talking about what happens when you don't invest in service design since well when you have poor design you're gonna end up with service and products that simply don't meet the needs of your customer or is not living delivering sufficient value new agile patterns help make this an easier process to achieve by having iterative and incremental approaches to service time and with the intention to continually adapt both the services and products but also the organization itself fine the other downside of poor service design is increased costs it can make things very expensive especially if things aren't operating as expected or there could be significant waste in the system all the while not meeting customer needs and then lastly they're depending on how poor the design is there's only so much that can be done potentially in terms of adapting or improving there's a fatal flaw very low on the stack or in be in the foundation of the service then that could be a significant significant constraint for the life of the service so let's take a look at a a couple of these things here or sort of these benefits the customer centric of customer centric yeah being more customer centric so you these design practices ensure that we're putting the customer first and that we're focusing on the value for them that we're looking at a holistic approach that we're looking at the overall experience the the customer experience or the user experience from beginning to end and with a focus on that outcome typically we get better estimates we see more success and more efficiency particularly in having that iterative and incremental approach organizations typically can have more confidence in their products but also you get more maintain ability with with less need for long term investment in the in the product of service in terms of holistic service design just wanna touch on here that what like to make sure that we have clarity on what that means that means that we need to consider the product and service all relevant stakeholders with a special focus on our on on our consumer other products and services both inside of what we offer and competitors in the in the marketplace existing architectures technology with keeping you my current and future requirements our service management practices but also how are we gonna measure and what are the metrics were the goals to ensure that we we know that we're of being successful a big part of service design these days is design thinking design thinking is a practical and human center approach that accelerates innovation design thinking activities include things like inspiration and empathy through the observation of people so that's taking hypothesis validating with simple experiments with with real people by observing how they work and how they interact products and services both in terms of how are they currently solving the problem and validating the hypothesis of we have product or service that'll be an improvement or deliver new value for those people idea aviation which combines diver and convergent thinking prototyping to test iterate and refine ideas implementation to bring concepts to life and lastly evaluation to measure performance and identify opportunities for improvement design things well aligned with agile software practices and lean software practices and this should be thought of as a an iterative process for practice considerations and it's important to keep in mind that service design is more effective when there's input for many stakeholders and you need to make sure that you're not having that that your design process service design practice isn't stuck in one or even two silos that you're really reaching out to the full organization but it's actually the a significant and representative range of stakeholder next we'll talk about the service desk this is defined in our book as the purpose of their service desk practices to capture demand for incident resolution and service requests it should also be the entry point and single point of contact for the service provider with all of its users so the activities of the service desk are to acknowledge that means that the user needs to know that their contact has been received for example if an issue reported by email you could send that user an an auto acknowledgement but more for fundamentally from a communications point of view successful communication means acknowledging receipt that people feel heard next once we've received an incident or an issue we need to classify it so that the service desk is able to best route or triage and ensure that the right team is able to address it whether it's the service desk itself or tier two tier three support we need to own this we need to make sure that the service deck desk owns the issue so and this is how we ensure that those issues don't get lost between teams or quote unquote fall between the cracks a sense of ownership particularly whoever receives the call is very important to make sure we get across the finish line and deliver the right outcome for the customer the right outcome doesn't necessarily mean that it's the issue was resolved their satisfaction ideally it would be but if we can't we still need to close that off of course we can transfer ownership especially when we escalate up to tier two or tier three and sometimes back down depending on the situation but the transfer of ownership needs to be clear and explicit and binding then lastly we need to act to resolve things the user satisfaction i will i will note here that we're not always gonna achieve the level of user satisfaction sometimes the user asks for things that are not possible or or simply not going to be feasible in terms of delivering sufficient value for both parties the organization and the and the consumer and in those situations we need to be thoughtful and as as played as possible on a while still feel delivering the unhappy names that we can't accommodate the request lock of different channels on how you could get to a service desk these days not only do we have all of these channels but also we could have virtual agents that operate from many locations so a different different call centers or potentially even people working from home additionally the other model centralized to a single call center all working together c located sometimes when a service desk is very technical that that the the kind of team members you need are gonna need significantly more technical information expertise to be able to satisfy the needs of of the requests coming in there are certainly other organizations where it's much less technical and in which case you have a much more flexible set of resources needed to run that team successful service desks need a need a key set of skills of primarily empathy and emotional intelligence it's but also effective communication now they also talk about customer service skills but i can't think of a lot of customer service skills that aren't covered by emotional intelligence and effective the last thing our it guy talks about those understanding of business priorities infinite analysis and prior prioritization and this is really important remember that value is measured both for the consumer and for the organization and when you're in the help desk situation or help us contacts is very easy or typically it's very easy to identify what the can customer consumer user is seeking what that is valuable for them but we need to always balance that with what's what the value is for the organization and we're gonna achieve that by ensuring that to our help our service task has a good understanding of those of our business needs and and our prioritization let's take a look at practice considerations it's really important the service desk is well respected seen as critical and championed you know a lot of people use service desk as a way to get in into jobs in the it industry and i think that's really excellent i you know i started on a service desk spent many years there and then i i moved up to tier two and tier three as a assistant analyst where i was building services but we we followed the pattern of having rotations back on the onto the service desk and i thought that it was a very important to maintain empathy and here what problem statements were like from our consumers directly as opposed to having a filtered through a ticket system or or whatever the the system wants next we'll take a look at service level management we we have a statement here from the alex it guide that the purpose of the service level of management practice is to set clear business based targets for service levels and to ensure that delivery of services is properly assessed monitored in man against those targets to make sure that we're on the same page i have we take a look at these definitions here from the iphone guide at a service level is one or more metrics that define expected or achieved service quality and that a service level agreement also known as an sla is a documented agreement with between a service provider and a customer that identifies both services required and the expected level of service for service level agreement success we need to have a few things we need to ensure that we have a clear definition they need to be related to outcomes we need to have agreement and they need to be simple so we need to ensure that these things are related to a defined service so the scope is clear and we need relate to outcomes not just operational metrics like ninety nine percent availability the agreement has to be clear between the customer and the service provider and once just to be clear they need need to be simple to read and understand if they're filled with technical jargon then wheat effectively you don't have a strong agreement service level management provides end to end visibility of an organization services by establishing a shared understanding what those service levels are gonna be by collecting analyzing storing and reporting on relevant metrics it also performs service reviews and identifies improvement opportunity and it captures in reports on service issues so certainly you can see how this practice intersect with many of the other practice is that we've talked about this one interfaces primarily with the business unit of consumers or our customers and are is often part of the end of a sales process and and ideally we gonna be relatively standardized it's very challenging to have different sla for different customers often they could be buckets or categories such as like a bronze silver level of of sla but you to have fine grained customization of sla is very expensive to manage for organization and typically will not be possible in terms of practice considerations we need to make sure that we have a strong agreement and that there's strong engagement and commitment to that agreement so in terms of service level management this isn't something that just gets implemented as a project and then you're one and done this is an ongoing continuous process that needs to be reviewed and kept up to date in fact this is an area where many organizations would hire a consultant to help them implement but while that can be a great way to kick start or or bootstrap your sla management your service level management practice it's very important that you follow that with sufficient investment so that the process doesn't sort of with will get forgotten as soon as that consultant has left next up service request management so what we have here is that the purpose of the service request management practice is to support the agreed quality of the service by handling all predefined user initiated service requests in an effective end user friendly manner here we have that a service is a request from a user or user's authorized representatives that initiates the service action which has been agreed as a normal part of service delivery so the normal part of service delivery is very very important in terms of types of service requests we can see that the you we would need to have have action information the provision access and then feedback as all parts of that service request flow or process in terms of what it takes for successful service request management service request management should be automated and standardize as much as possible we need to ensure we're focused on continuing improvement for this policies need to be used to allow you a request to be filled with appropriate authorization so i'll just take a moment to talk more about that it's important we don't have too many checks or approval points for requesting new services a a manager's requesting new email addresses or somebody asking for more software licenses i as long as we're in the in in the realm of well defined understood and predictable requests which service request management is all about and we want people to be able to take those things on themselves and not have to wait we live in an on demand world and just in time is very very important every time we put another excuse what i mean every time we put another approval point could wait you know half a day a day two days before someone the human has an opportunity to go and check a box that's that that's gonna be the strong negative for the success of the service user expectations need to be clearly set what is available and who can request them and turnaround time of requests would all be examples of those expectations and then lastly we need be able to triage them requests that are actually incidents or changes need to be redirected to the appropriate practice now if you're a very small team this could all this could be all the same people and maybe even the same tool that doesn't mean so in that that situation the key thing is ensuring that you're correctly categorizing the user interaction but for a very large organization it could mean transferring them to an entirely different team and potentially even using different software or at least a different different interface to that same system of record service requests of course just like any other process could be could have simple or complex workflows this is a place where we wanna have very well established and well understood proven workflows the service provider organization will agree to fulfillment times and provide clear status updates to the request and some service requests can be fulfilled via self service so that's that automation piece times for example requesting a new piece of software access or printer would be good examples of those kinds of requests taking a look at practice considerations it's very important that management live these values if you're telling everyone that there's only two kinds of laptops that you're gonna provision lenovo and dell it's really frustrating for the rest of the team to see an executive walk around with a mac air book for example so the same thing could be of software licenses or access to quota or whatever it is now if if there's legitimate needs for instance if the design team needs to have max alright to but we need need to have clear consistent rules and if you don't have everyone especially leadership living the values of the of all of our practices then it's gonna be very difficult to convince people to to get on board when you look at these kinds of the of this particular practice one other thing to keep in mind is that approvals could incur costs for instance new phones new hardware servers things like that so it is important that authorization for these kinds of requests is carefully audited and frequently validated to make sure that budgets are within their expected scope and that there isn't excessive waste in the organization next we'll look at service validation and testing our it guides states of the purpose of the service validation and testing practice is to ensure that new or changed products and services meet defined requirements the definition of service value is based on input from customers of business objectives and regulatory requirements and is document as part of the value chain ti design and transition these inputs are used to establish measurable quality and performance indicators that support the definition to of assurance criteria and testing requirements lots going on there let's talk a little bit about the kinds the two key kinds of service validation tests i think this will help flesh out what that very long and highly technical jargon filled definition was we really talk about two kinds of of tests utility also referred to as functional and warranty also referred to as non functional i really dislike the language functional and non functional the idea of non functional features never sat quite right with me because they're very very important and i really like this language of utility and warranty much much better but i i would do acknowledge that functional and non functional important tests or requirements are still quite prevalent so i wanna make sure that you're aware of that as well in terms of utility tests we see unit system integration and regression tests so these are very much focused on the function of the product or service itself in terms of warranty this is be around the context of the robustness or availability of that service so we see things here like performance and capacity security compliance and just operational testing overall service validation focuses on the creation and agreement of deployment and release management acceptance criteria that's going to address both utility and warranty testing and must be based on customer requirements please be very clear that these are not things that are determined independently by the it organization they need to have input from customers to ensure that we're meeting the right the right needs and therefore delivering the right kind of value acceptance criteria are then measured via testing based on the organization's testing strategy practice considerations for this it was just so important that we focus or are clear on how critical it is that the test is independent that doesn't mean it has to be external but for example the people who build and make the service should not be the same people who test it while there is a nice alignment there of expertise they also have a strong bias to say that it works whether that's implicit or explicit it's a it's a good practice to separate of the teams for development testing for new or changes in any service the other thing is that the there's a certain pressure on developers to meet deadlines and the testers ideally would would not have that they should be measured by the effectiveness of their testing and the quality of the code now i would also say that more contemporary thoughts on testing and quality include everyone and that ensures that quality is a shared value but this still makes good sense keep in mind also that your testing environment is something that that requires a lot of care and investment and it needs to have as closer match to your live or production environment as possible any drift between your test environment and your life environment starts to introduce the possibility that your testing is not valid to have the for instance if we're talking about servers having the exact same server image would be great i keep in mind that load and and volume of data which is really another way of thinking load network connectivity are all things that should be modeled and matched it closely as possible data in the test environment also need to be protected in the same way as live data and as well as licensing so if part of that stack is licensed then you need to address that as well now some vendors will allow you to have free licenses for test environments and that's that i think that's fair because you're not really delivering value directly with them it's indirect but sometimes that's not the case from an operations perspective the test environment could look like an extension of the spares storage area that's that's possible and then when when what that allows you to do is if you have an outage or break then you might wanna grab something from your test environment i would strongly recommend that you don't do this the test environment has to be protected of the testing it'd be carried out at any time if you have a significant break and then you pull in material or you reuse or repurpose resources from your testing environment one of the potential outcomes is that when your system is back up you need to run a test and now you have no place to do that at all so that's a tough decision really this this shouldn't be the kind of situation that you encounter in production you don't wanna have to make this decision when your service is down this is definitely the kind of thing you wanna plan for ahead of time and that wraps up topic two service management practices
Unit 9 - Topic 3.webm: and now we'll take a look at our final topic delivering technical management practices this topic has a far far fewer practices just three employment management information and platform management in software development and management so let's get started with deployment management our it ideal guide states of the purpose of the development management practices to move new or changed hardware software documentation processes or any other component to live environments it may also be involved in deploying components to other environments for testing or staging so what's extremely important here is to be very clear on the breadth of things that deployment management covers certainly software and services but you know as they said processes documentation as long as it's going from a development phase to a production or live phase or environment then we can think about using our deployment management practice there are four key kinds of deployment approaches that it ideal lists or considers keeping in mind that deployment management needs to be needs to have a very close collaboration with released management and change enable the intersection of these practices is essential for all of them to be successful in for organizations to deliver the right kind of value so based on the kind of the different needs of your organization you can look at one of these for option which cover pretty much all the options for deployment phase deployment and it deploy the part of an organization or target group such as a particular office a country a customer each time rather than whole organization at once continuous delivery components are integrated test and deploy that's needed tip typically with an automated pipeline saas services such as the netflix and amazon are are have a very strong practice and that kind of continuous delivery big bang deployment the deployment is delivered to the whole organization or target group at the same time and then pull deployment users can download the software when they choose to that last option you've probably seen on things like a facebook or twitter when there's a new interface and you're offered the opportunity to check it out and use it before before the release is required or in terms of practice considerations you know deployment management is a is a a classic case of when everything goes right no one notices it and people only know about it or ask about it when there's a problem you know i have been part of an it organization that dealt with an azure outage because of a mistake made the deployment mistake made and that it had a multi hour north american outage so these gonna have very high states it's very important that we have the right processes in place field deployments will of course have a a big impact on customers user satisfaction but also things such as reputation in brand ensuring have the right controls in place and they don't have to be complicated but ensuring we have the right controls in place can definitely provide significant benefit we wanna make sure that the comp integrity of all components before the point that deployment has been checked that all the right levels of access and that we have the right audit trail are the right analytics of what's happening so that we're able to make sure that we're safe to deploy or sorry save quote or that we're able to immediately and hopefully in real time have the opportunity to diagnose a problem when a deployment has not walked out as we had hoped we wanna make sure that we're regular reviewing these tools and the continuous improvement is definitely a very important part of this practice like all of them but this there's particular risks to customer satisfaction and value here so keeping an eye on that it's very important next we take a look at infrastructure and platform management the ideal guide states of the purpose of the infrastructure and platform management practice is to oversee the infrastructure and platforms used by organization when carried out properly this practice enables the monitoring of technology solutions platforms available to the organization including the technology of external service providers so we will this was definitely gonna be tied to things like health checks status updates or dashboards things like that and it's increasingly common to integrate internal and external services and environments as part of what you're reporting on in particular because increasingly we're using organizations will use external certain is that are key to their service their service delivery to their consumers these so we have these different resources that we could measure or or take a look at the i think this ain't go on quite a bit longer this is a pretty good strategic list of resources we don't have to list much more than this but literally it'd be that you know dozens or more things dozens it doesn't or or more of above these kinds of resources infrastructure and platform management you know includes the provision of technology to support value creating activities and adopting new technologies as they emerge so part of this overall practice is making sure that we're using the best technology and just a moment on what best means here best does not necessarily mean the fastest cheapest largest capacity best means the best fit for our environment our use and will deliver the most value for our customers in the end each organization needs to create its own infrastructure regardless of how much things are out in the cloud we still need to have some level of infrastructure at this point at a minimum mark our our team's client computers and things like that it'd be rare for an organization to be a hundred percent in the cloud in terms of every part of of its it infrastructure but i'm well i'm sure we'll get there and there's probably some organizations there now but you know all organizations need to create the to their own infrastructure and and because of that we'll need the platform management strategy to meet consumer needs now into the future yeah in the past infrastructure and platform management which has traditionally been part of it operations has has been seen as a blocker or a friction point that's always so slow for devs to get access to their test servers or things like that which is a ton of growth in and and development in the last few years particularly operation there's a service and site rely reliability engineering operations as a service is how an operations team are or an external supplier will work with the development team to create environments that meet their needs fully the team that offers operation as a service will care all the environmental administration let's seem security backups capacity management access onboarding off onboarding things like that now these kinds of vendors are emerging that offers specialized capabilities increasingly so this is what i mean by we're not there yet where organizations will have full or all their it structure in the cloud or provide it as a service and even then we still need to make sure that our our team has great computers and and are able to collaborate do their work site reliability engineering was pioneered by google and it's a discipline or a a to a technique that uses software engineering techniques in operations to create scalable and our reliable systems this has been a very successful and it has we're seeing pretty significant uptake across the it industry access to advances in technology can include cloud hosting and server functions those kinds of things can all make infrastructure and platform management much more effective and faster and to add on to that often there's some pretty good cost benefits as well while all of these online hosted services in the cloud with a cloud deployment are consumption based we can also see that you can get access to much much larger sets of resources almost instantly at a very low cost but that does need to be balanced out with what the ongoing consumption costs are and if you have a fixed set of resources then typically investing in your own resources are better or if you have a fixed need in resources so if you know how much capacity you need or how much compute you need then typically simply buying the hardware is gonna be more efficient in in terms of resource allocation on terms of cost the cloud hosting system really shines when you don't have clarity or a precise understanding of what you're capacity requirements will be and that actually describes most situations which was one of the reasons like cloud hosting has been so it's successful alright our last technical management practice is software development management our it ideal guide states that the purpose of the software development and management practice is to ensure that applications meet internal and external stakeholder needs in terms of functionality reliability and maintain ability compliance and we could also talk about that being available or meet the need in terms of utility and warranty requirements from our previous topic let's take a look at the activities that we have here i won't read them all but i don't think there's any surprises here i particularly like the last one of control sharing and management of code it's often underestimated how how much value or or also how complex it can be to successfully deploy those kinds of solutions you know keeping in mind that also that most software development today will follow either waterfall or agile and but that isn't to say that there aren't other options there's software and development management is always evolving and there's agile doesn't mean one thing scrum is certainly popular but you know can kanban work in progress lots of different options there and and in the last couple of years there's been a lot of friction or push back against agile it's a sort of become a mature standard that's d facto and so that's it's natural that there's some some interest in seeking alternatives so when and i i have a sense that's gonna continue to be very strong and critiques about that i've seen have i've been pretty thin in my opinion but how we work with technology is gonna continue to develop and we only need to adapt to it just as we adapting technologies you know assessing whether your software development and man for practices are doing well i could really you know look at the outcomes and look at your customer satisfaction you know if we've seen huge changes and benefits of from adopting agile practices and as as we continue to integrate agile methods so with our software development but also broader through our business practices lot financial management we continue to see us a a strong dividends but we we really wanna do here while all the agile stuff is great no shorten the feedback loop be customer centric focus on outcomes all those kinds of things the key thing is to be really really clear that software development is not a a project you know which is a temporary effort with you know beginning at an end even when a new piece of software is release it's not finished that that release of the software is finished the only time software is finished is when you stop working on but even then i'm sure we'd all have the experience of using software well past its it's supported data and as long as it gonna be one on a computer then that software or continues and there's even situations where new companies will take over the care maintenance and provide updates as security updates and new functionality for products that they didn't build so really really important to focus on how how much software development is a ongoing process it's a continual and not a one and done or a finite project and that's it for the unit overall so if any questions please let me know and we'll we'll have a a great conversation on that
Unit1.webm: hi there this is professor y and welcome to unit one managing change in this unit we'll be looking at the overall concept of change management particular we'll be starting our exploration and understanding of project management and service management and by the end of this you should have a good idea of the difference between the two we have three key topics that we'll be covering in this unit the majority of this unit is looking at that project management versus service management we'll also touch on waterfall versus agile methodologies and then lastly we'll touch on the importance of the culture of change so we'll get some acronyms out of the way throughout the course we'll refer to these two things quite a bit project management as pm and service management as s m certainly feel free to use those anywhere that you like in in your written material or things like that if if it's a an assignment that you're that's a report or a presentation i would say use full form but in any discussion post or anything like that feel free to use the short forms so pm stands for project management you're probably familiar with pm the project management professional certification sm is service management it also has a certification called it also a little bit of confusion here or a couple of options here it's often referred to as it or it m and we'll talk a little bit more about that later on the why but sm m it till it m all the same thing and i apologize for the confusion that's where we are with the industry so let's talk a little bit about what a project is so you can see this list of examples here before we get into a definition and i i like this a lot because has got some very old things and some very new things on it and in particular the last few options there software gps and launching this international space station are all very it related activities and i think quite relevant for what we're looking at here but you can see we've had projects for a very long time and you know any kind of major change that there's gonna be a lot of investment in then it could probably benefit from project management and we could think of it as a project so what's service well first of all wanna make sure that we're scoping this down to it services and not other kinds of services and that means not things like medical service or a taxi service or things like that so i think the first example i'd like talk about is e econ which is a service it's a a software as a service hosted by a company called d two i i used to work for them so where we're having this course right now is a service office three sixty five which we use for email and our productivity tools like word and powerpoint things like that that's definitely service as well netflix xbox ultimate which is kinda like the netflix of xbox games also good examples of services i like the example of world of warcraft a lot which is a video game certainly there's a product there as well the the game itself that you play the game client but if you can't connect to their hosted service you really can't play at all there's no solo local mode or anything like that and then lastly azure and aws or both platform as a service or entire infrastructure as a service probably we will play an important role in in your it career service if it doesn't already so what is project management well there's of course many ways to define it but in the it industry and and in this course we're gonna stick with a meaning that's defined by the pm ba so that's another term we're gonna hear a lot in this course so i wanna make sure that you're familiar with it it stands for the project management body of knowledge and it's published by pm and it's based on an ans standard so let's talk about those hacker the pm is the product management institute you can go to their webs site pm m i dot org for more information and they're the organization that manages and licenses the pm p certification site an z is the american national standards institute they are responsible for their standards organization and they published a standard called the standard for project management based on lots of real world experience and learning and that's what the pm certification and the pm ba are both based on now it's very important to understand that because project management needs to be tailored to fit the needs of the project and indeed of the organization that the standard in the guide are both based on descriptive practices rather than prescriptive practices so let's be sure that we all understand what that means this standard the project manager to the pm standard describes processes that are considered good practices on most projects most of the time but it's just as important to understand that this also means that this standard does not prescribe how every part of every project must be done it also does things like identify you know what the inputs and outputs are for those different processes but there the standard does not at any time require that any particular process or practice be performed that's really important to understand that the pm box the pm p and and all the project management practices we talk about nothing is required it's all optional and what you need to do is understand the function and value of those different processes so you can figure out the ones that are best fit for the project and organizations that you're working with i'll also mention that there's about one million certified pm p practitioners today so let's look at defining projects in project management so what is a project and what is project management will these both come from p of the pm and a project and i'll i'll read this a project is a temporary and endeavor undertaking to create unique product service or result that is a lot going on there and we'll unpack that in a minute but let's also check in on what project management is and it's the application of knowledge schools tools and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements that's pretty straightforward i think we'll look back w at this in a moment when we look at some of the definitions for service and service management they're not quite as clean but this is really nice and clear the thing i really wanna focus on the most is this temporary part right here that that's a very very important part of what a project is that it has a beginning in an end in terms of project management a pretty straightforward there you know doing the things it takes to get a project done okay what's the next so let's take a look at what service management is so once again there are many ways to define it a service management in the same way that i said there are many ways to define project management in the it industry in this course standard meeting is defined by it so tel was originally an acronym for information technology infrastructure library that actually just is means it now they've they've done away with the acronym but what's really important here is this is also intended to be a set of descriptive practices so i talked a little bit about the pm and the standard that it was based on is owned by which is a joint venture brewing capita and it process outsourcing outsourcing company and the yu and the uk government in particular the cabinet office in it it tl v four certification is is licensed by ax there's an iso standard at trivia which one but the there's an iso standard that this is based on so both it till and product project management come out of a standards bodies that have identified best practices from learned experience and cod those into a standard practice and body of knowledge so the it m or i it ideal practitioners provided lots of information to help form this in the eighties so this is quite a mature standard and it offers a practical approach that's evolved over many years something that you're gonna see as we talk about it four is that we've is that it four really brings in the idea of value and being a value system having a focus on value throughout your systems and that means that organizations need to focus less on technology and more on how to c create value with internal external customers and we'll talk more about what that means but one of the a simple way to begin that conversation is to describe it as in the past your it department was simply a cost center and now we're looking for ways to c create value that might be revenue it might be other product opportunities or training opportunities or things like that but it's really important that it departments are no longer simply a cost center and are delivering value to the organization as well there's something that's really important about it it it is very it focus the project management standard is not so it focused the project management framework and tools pm ba can be used from construction to hardware software building a playground running music festival it doesn't matter it is completely agnostic and the same principle applies here as well to service management but it's a little bit more important to talk about the fact that it's vendor neutral it is not to provided by a single supplier or based on the single technology or even one industry so that means it's easily adopted across all types and sizes of organization something that it shares with the project management standards that it's non prescriptive organizations need to adopt and adapt the elements of it ideal to work for them and their customers there's also nothing that is prescribed that you must do to be it ideal certified as an organization in fact you can't ideal certification is something that people get lastly it's based on best practices again another similarity to the project management standard ideal draws on experience from service management practitioners from around the globe and i'll also note there's about two million certified or certified with around the world from so we looked at the definitions of product project and project management let's take a look at the standard definitions from it on service and service management service is a service is a means of enabling value c creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks that's a that's a lot and i don't even i don't really know what that means this really feels like it was written by committee i think it's a very specific very precise kind of definition and i think it serves the eye to literature well i i don't think it's a great learning tool and i don't think it's the kind of thing you'd wanna put on a t shirt or anything like that the key thing here is that service delivers some kind of value and that customers don't have to do it all that's that's the simple part or the simple way thinking about it then looking at the the official definition of service management this is a set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services so i i think that's a it's a it's an accurate definition but it doesn't really help us understand what service manager it is and to be fair it's a very broad practice that's has a lot of different dimensions to it so i don't think i don't think it's be you're there's a better alternative let's put it that way but it it is not the most inviting or accessible of definitions so let's start to think a little bit about what's different between project management and service management for me i think the really key thing to focus on this how projects are one time remember in that definition of project there was that keyword of temporary that i highlighted so this is a a one time unique event so think process right beginning middle end service management on the other hand is ongoing there's a focus on value and think cycle so we look at those options that examples list you know with whether you're building pyramids or making the polio vaccine or launching software application there's a beginning in the middle of an end in terms of services if you think about the examples i had there mean like netflix or aws or something like that it's ongoing in fact the one of the key values of those kinds of services is there up uptime and how little they ever stopped so so i hope that helps it this is a an important concept if if you're not sure make sure that you ask and check with your peers but i'm really happy to help you through that through that piece of learning as well with so we definitely talked about what's different between project management and service management but let's also spend some time thinking about how they're the same or what they have in common and you know they're both about managing change that's why this unit's called managing change and change management is the the broad foundation for the entire course but more importantly i think like the reasons that we invest in them you're gonna see that there's a lot of process involved with both of these a lot of steps a lot of investment to do them well so why would you spend all those calories why would you spend all the time money and resources to to use these frameworks well it's because you wanna reduce the risk of the of the outcome that you're looking for of not sorry rules the risk of not achieving the outcome at all of the entire project of the service simply failing you also want better outcomes you know this is these are proven methods to not only cross the finish line but you know do very well when you do so that it helps increase predictability it also allows us to reuse learning not only from the wisdom of thousands of professionals over decades now but also within our own organizations as as we continue to refine these processes in a descriptive way not a prescriptive way inside of our own organizations and within our own practices and then lastly they both are you know focused on that des descriptive of over pre prescriptive so they're both interested in adapting to best fit your needs alright so let's talk a little bit about waterfall versus agile so waterfall versus at these are a soft where development methodologies and i think that they are very useful for us to think about in like context of project management and service management if you're not familiar waterfall software development is where yeah there's each step so and then when that step is complete you move on to the next one so you can see the graphic here sort of indicates that waterfall process but you're able to move on to the next ones you complete the previous so in the waterfall fall you methodology software development methodology you would first collect all requirements and then once you have all your requirements then you would design once your designs are all done then you would build it once you finished building it you'll test it then you would launch and move into maintenance you can see on the right hand side here that agile is cyclical and seeks to iterate or repeat these sequence so instead of having a one and done format like waterfall agile you know starts off the backlog things that you wanna do then it analyzes defined design test and then deploy but it it continues that process you'll also notice that you don't necessarily deploy after one rotation or one iteration you you may do that several times before you deploy so what does this have to do with project and project management service management well you know that waterfall software methodology you know each step must be complete before progressing sometimes this is called a phase gate approach that you can't exit a phase until you pass that gate and it's a linear process you can't go back of course i mean you could go back but it it'd be very very expensive and it breaks the the convention of the methodology it is however we're very well suited for the physical world so when you build say a skyscraper or any actually waterfall makes a lot of sense you cannot start laying the foundation until you have all the services plumb in because you really it's incredibly expensive but prohibitive expensive to go back and do that you can't bring in your electrician until the walls are up you can't bring in your drywall wall until until the electrician are done so there's very much there's a very clear process in sequence and that has to be followed i think there are some useful parallels to project management here in the in the way that it's a time bound beginning in middle end very process oriented i wanna be clear though and i'm gonna return to this comparison of project management being more waterfall but it's not a perfect fit and i wanna be clear i'm not saying that project management is waterfall in fact there's quite a bit of work that's been done that's quite excellent around agile project management so that's something for us to to think about as well so let's talk about agile so if you're not familiar with agile software development you know it allows you to create typically something like a two week sprint and then you're able to quickly fit decide what you're gonna build but you can rapidly show shift and rep prioritize return to design and the graphic that i have here is a is a graph of merge changes it shows lots of different parallel work that's all brought together later on and you can see that they have all kinds of different functions so things aren't happening in a in a one and done or a phase gate process things are able to easily iterate back and forth so again the key things here that agile is sick cyclical it steps follow a repeating sequence but most importantly it's a continuous process and an opportunity to loop back this is particularly well suited for the digital world if you've ever you know hit undo and then redone or reenter some text or any kind of activity like that and that's exactly what this kind of process is and i think there's some useful parallels to service management in the idea that it's cyclical a call and continuous and that it's iterative that being said just like i observe with project management that doesn't necessarily mean that service management is agile there's certainly a way to to get a waterfall style decision making and process into service management as well i typically think that's not the the best idea but you know again there's nothing prescriptive about these systems they're descriptive and end of the day it's up to you in your organization to adapt and define these processes to meet your needs to maximize your success okay so the last unit the last topic sorry for unit one is looking at the culture of change what i wanna be what i wanna introduce you here to you here is the idea of how important culture which is about people is to everything that we're gonna talk about in this entire course there's a lot to cover and we're gonna be really focused on the definitions and the processes and and the practices as defined by these two systems however i do not want us to ever forget that ultimately this is all about people so if we take a look at some big headlines from important magazines like harbor business review in forbes they very consistently talk about how difficult changes in that simply having a list of things to change is not the hard part it's creating the culture that is willing to accept the change and then sustain the change i think all of us have probably had the experience of wanting to make a change in ourselves whether it's how we eat or how often we work out maybe there's a new year's resolution that we've attempted and it didn't stick that's because change is hard habits are are a very strong part of human behavior and change can be uncomfortable and scary and that emotional part is a very important part of managing projects and and managing services so i wanna make sure that we're you know keeping in mind that there's lots of that in our organizations and our customers in our peers as so many people all these different groups that you know we need to understand how they fit together and how they connect and how could make sure that we're running project and services that are sec successful for these different constituents for these different stakeholders and that we are able to do that all the same time it's a lot but i also want us to keep in mind that you know as we zoom in say just to our organization we really need to keep the fact that these are people that we're trying to help that there that we talk about requirements and skills and outcomes and that's very important very clean language so that we have a shared vocabulary that we can be clear in how we communicate about project and service goals in planning but just please don't forget that ultimately the reason we invest in the project the reason we invest in this services to help people but most importantly it's to help a person and i don't mean one specific person i'm not saying that the projects to help you know this one person with an umbrella and a cell phone and a shoulder bag but that if we are not able to be successful at the level of people then we're not gonna be successful so let's make sure that we don't lose track of that throughout this and we'll return to this idea several times throughout the course the other very important thing about the culture of change is i really want to make sure that you're really clear and confident the that all change management is an attempt to predict the future and i don't know if you ever tried to predict the future but it's a very hard thing to do so please be prepared to get it wrong i don't mean get it wrong in this course i'm sure you're gonna study hard and i'm gonna give you the support you need to be six cecil in the course but i mean when you're running a project you're running a service all of those things are about planning and execution they're about allocating resources and estimating capacity and and future needs and the capacity planning all those kinds of things and you're gonna get it wrong you're gonna get it wrong because if it was easy to predict the future you know you you'd never get caught in the rain predicting the future is a very difficult thing and all planning is guessing and all project management all service management ultimately is some kind of an attempt to predict the future so and then they're all informed by best practices remember best practices are not perfect practices so you know we're dealing with an imperfect world and imperfect systems imperfect people things are gonna be imperfect and that's okay so i just mentioned best practices so what is the best practice i we're gonna talk about best practices a lot we already talked about how both standards the the pm ba and the tail are both based on best practices but let's let's make sure we're really clear on what we mean by best practice i i wanna do this to make because it's a it's a key concept it's important that you understand this but i've also had many frustrating conversations in the workplace or in in it teams and software engineering teams that get hung up on what a best practice actually is so let's let's get clear on what we mean by that for this course and how i hope that you'll use this term in your career so i think the wikipedia article here definition here it's actually quite good so a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternative because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things so when we say best practices we mean best that we have not best in the universe of possibility i've had long arguments with developers or system administrators around the world that's not best this is best and what we mean is best that we have but not only that and this is very important in my experience a a key thing that separates a a more junior professional for more senior professional and a large technical organization is understanding that what's best for one organization may not necessarily be best for another the context of your existing systems in your goals your resources is these are all important factors into determining what the best practices for you so while and this is why both systems are talked are very clear and being descriptive and not prescriptive because since they don't know that context they're gonna give you all of the options and you're gonna choose the ones that work the best for you and for your organization and that's why it's so important that we focus on descriptive practices and not prescriptive practice i'll actually mention here that i really like that the wikipedia article goal uses the word superior i actually think superior practice would be a better term but i think it's not as catchy people like being best and and that trip is sailed so the other thing i'll mention is that it's it's important to note that the this little tiny last bit of the definition here or be because it has become a standard way of doing things that can be really frustrating for some people that a best practice is just the way that it's done there might actually be a better way and when we have that opportunity that's what we call innovation and it's really great to be able to seize that and be able to move forward on that but also understand that that takes a lot of energy and sometimes the business decision is that we're not here to innovate we're right here to improve that practice we're here to get this other job done improving that practice isn't one of our requirements right now so that's an important thing that you'll have to learn to balance as well okay so for this wrapping up unit one i have a an exercise please read the three articles from the previous slide i've posted this up in discussions and write a short two hundred and fifty to five hundred word reflection on all three like you know what you think about this and this is an important time to to to think about and how i can see you bring together multiple p sources of information but also think about to me what is the the overarching strategic concept of this course which is how do we manage change which is a one way how we manage people that's why we have all these systems and that's what this course is all about i wanna be clear this is not a marked assignment but it's a really important a first opportunity for me to see your analytical and writing skills and provide support and direction for that so yeah checkout out discussions i'll soon as i've posted this this video i'll unlock or show that so that you can see that as and i look forward to reading your responses for that i hope that was great if you have any questions please let me know i have a set up discussions called questions where you can ask any question there about the course i will keep an eye on that of course and i'm looking forward to responding and answering your questions i also wanna make sure that you know that i'm really looking forward to seeing how you help each other big part of project management and it service management is about serve serving our colleagues but how do we help enable their success that's what these systems are all about that's something that i i think it's important that we focus on and acknowledge but also model in this course so thank you very much i hope that unit one was was interesting and useful for you i look forward to your feedback and your questions
Week 1 Survey Results.webm: hi there professor y here i wanted to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded to our weekly survey i'm happy to see that there's some positive and i think it's very understandable that there's some dissatisfaction here i know that we're not off to the best start and i'm working hard to get us on track as fast as possible i'm really hoping that we're in a much better state by the end of this week i'll also observe that with four responses that puts us at less than twenty five percent of the class you responded i wanna assure you that this is a hundred percent anonymous i don't see who saying what and i can't know what your response is so if if you are not happy then i really need to know that and if you could also share some comments on how i could improve that's really important if i don't have that information then i won't be able to do a course correction to get us into a better a better place for the course i really hope that everyone participate in the survey i shared the the results each week and what we will do is on the the monday after a week so this is the monday after week two i'll post the new survey and you'll have the entire week to fill it out on the previous week i hope that makes sense and is useful for you i wanted to make sure that you have as much time as possible just keep in mind that you're not providing feedback in the current week but on the previous week other than that i'd also share that in the comments so one of the things that was requested was a real time meeting and you can see that we now have a weekly real time meeting that we're starting tomorrow so this i'm very interested in hearing your feedback i'm very open to making adjustments to the course so that we can have a better experience and i can better support your success in the course and i'm really looking forward to seeing all of you at our course meeting tomorrow on ms teams if you have any questions please just get in touch thanks so much
